      Now that we have developed some machinery for power series,
      we are ready to connect them to the earlier chapters.
      Our first big goal in this chapter is to prove that every power series represents a holomorphic function in its disk of convergence and,
      vice versa,
      that every holomorphic function can be locally represented by a power series.

    <p>
      Our second goal returns to our motivation to start <xref ref="powerchapter">Chapter</xref>:
      we'd still like to compute<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_laurentmotivation"/>,
      <me>
        \int_{ C[2,3] } \frac{ \exp(z) }{ \sin(z) } \, \diff{z} \,
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back at <xref ref="fig_laurentmotivation">Figure</xref>
      suggests that we expand the function
      <m>\frac{ \exp(z) }{ \sin(z) }</m> locally into something like power series centered at 0 and <m>\pi</m>,
      and with any luck we can then use <xref ref="seriesintegral">Proposition</xref> to integrate.
      Of course, <m>\frac{ \exp(z) }{ \sin(z) }</m> has singularities at 0 and <m>\pi</m>,
      so there is no hope of computing power series at these points.
      We will develop an analogue of a power series centered at a singularity.
