    <p>
      On the surface, this chapter is just a collection of exercises.
      They are more involved than any of the ones we've given so far
      at the end of each chapter, 
      which is one reason why we will lead you through each of the
      following ones step by step. 
      On the other hand,
      these sections should really be thought of as a continuation of
      the book, 
      just in a different format.
      All of the following problems are of a
      <em>discrete</em> mathematical nature,
      and we invite you to solve them using <em>continuous</em>
      methods<mdash/>namely, complex integration.
      There are very few results in mathematics that so intimately
      combine discrete and continuous mathematics as does the Residue
