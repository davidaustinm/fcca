      Cauchy's Theorem and Integral Formula
      (<xref ref="cauchythm">Theorems</xref>
      and <xref ref="cauchyformula"></xref>),
      which we now have at our fingertips,
      are not just beautiful results but also incredibly practical.
      In a quite concrete sense,
      the rest of this book will reap the fruits that these two theorems provide us with.
      This chapter starts with a few highlights.
