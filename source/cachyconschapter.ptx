      Cauchy's Theorem and Integral Formula
      (<xref ref="cauchythm"/>
      and <xref ref="cauchyformula"/>),
      which we now have at our fingertips,
      are not just beautiful results but also incredibly practical.
      In a quite concrete sense,
      the rest of this book will reap the fruits that these two
      theorems provide us with. 
      This chapter starts with a few highlights.
