  <title>Mean-Value and Maximum/Minimum Principle</title>
  <p>
    We have established an intimate connection between harmonic and
    holomorphic functions, 
    and so it should come as no surprise that some of the theorems we
    proved for holomorphic functions have analogues in the world of
    harmonic functions. 
    Here is such a harmonic analogue of Cauchy's Integral Formula
    (<xref ref="cauchyformulacircle"/>
    and <xref ref="cauchyformula"/>).

  <theorem xml:id="harmonicmeanvalue">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>u</m> is harmonic in the region <m>G</m> and
        <m>\overline D[w,r] \subset G</m>. 
        Then
        <me>
          u(w) \ = \ \frac 1 {2 \pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} u \! \left( w + r \,

        <xref ref="ex_biggerdisk"/>
        provides <m>R</m> so that <m>\overline D[w,r] \subset
        D[w,R]\subset G</m>. 
        The open disk <m>D[w,R]</m> is simply connected,
        so by <xref ref="harmonictoholomorphic">Theorem</xref>
        there is a function <m>f</m> holomorphic in <m>D[w,R]</m> such
        that <m>u = \Re f</m> on <m>D[w,R]</m>. 
        Now we apply <xref ref="meanvalue"/> to <m>f</m>:
        <me>
          f(w) \ = \ \frac 1 {2 \pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} f \! \left( w + r \,

        <xref ref="harmonicmeanvalue"/>
        follows by taking the real part on both sides.

    say that holomorphic and harmonic functions have the
    <em>mean-value property</em>.
    Our next result is an important consequence of this property to
    extreme values of a function. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G \subset \C</m> be a region.
        The function <m>u : G \to \R</m> has a
        <em>strong relative maximum</em>
        at <m>w \in G</m> if
        there exists a disk <m>D[w,r] \subseteq
        G</m> such that 
        <m>u(z) \le u(w)</m> for all <m>z \in D[w,r]</m> and
        <m>u(z_0) \lt u(w)</m> for some <m>z_0 \in D[w,r]</m>.
        <idx><h>maximum</h><h>strong relative</h></idx>
        The definition of a <em>strong relative minimum</em> is analogous.

        <idx><h>max/min property for harmonic functions</h></idx>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <theorem xml:id="harmonicmaxmin">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>u</m> is harmonic in the region <m>G</m>,
        then it does not have a strong relative maximum or minimum
        in<nbsp/><m>G</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Assume, by way of contradiction,
        that <m>w</m> is a strong relative maximum.
        Then there is a disk in <m>G</m> centered at <m>w</m> containing
        a point <m>z_0</m> with <m>u(z_0) \lt  u(w)</m>. 
        Let <m>r := |z_0 - w|</m> and apply <xref
        ref="harmonicmeanvalue"/>:
        <me>
          u(w) \ = \ \frac 1 {2 \pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} u \! \left( w + r \,
          e^{it} \right) \diff{t} \, 
          </me>.
        Intuitively, this cannot hold,
        because some of the function values we're integrating are
        smaller than <m>u(w)</m>, 
        contradicting the mean-value property.
        To make this into a thorough argument,
        suppose that <m>z_0 = w + r \, e^{it_0}</m> for <m>0 \leq t_0
        \lt  2\pi</m>. 
        Because <m>u(z_0) \lt  u(w)</m> and <m>u</m> is continuous,
        there is a whole interval of parameters <m>[t_0, t_1] \subseteq
        [0, 2 \pi]</m> such that 
        <m>u( w + r \, e^{it}) \lt  u(w)</m> for <m>t_0 \le t \le t_1</m>.
        Now we split up the mean-value integral:
        <md>
          <mrow>u(w) \amp \ = \ \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} u \! \left(
          w + r \, e^{it} \right) \diff{t}
          </mrow> 
          <mrow>\amp \ = \ \frac 1 {2 \pi} \left( \int_0^{t_0} u \! \left(
          w + r \, e^{it} \right) \diff{t} + \int_{t_0}^{t_1} u \!
          \left( w + r \, e^{it} \right) \diff{t} \right.
          </mrow> 
          <mrow>\amp \qquad \qquad  + \left. \int_{t_1}^{2 \pi} u
          \! \left( w + r \, e^{it} \right) \diff{t} \right) .</mrow> 
        </md>
        All the integrands can be bounded by <m>u(w)</m>;
        for the middle integral we get a
        <em>strict</em> inequality.
        Hence
        <me>
          u(w) \ \lt  \ \frac 1 {2 \pi} \left( \int_0^{t_0} u(w) \,
          \diff{t} + \int_{t_0}^{t_1} u(w)\, \diff{t} + \int_{t_1}^{2
          \pi} u(w) \, \diff{t} \right) \ = \ u(w) \, 
          </me>,
          a contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same argument works if we assume that <m>u</m> has a
        relative minimum. 
        But in this case there's a shortcut argument:
        if <m>u</m> has a strong relative minimum then the harmonic
        function <m>-u</m> has a strong relative maximum, 
        which we just showed cannot exist.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    So far, harmonic functions have benefited from our knowledge of
    holomorphic functions. 
    Here is a result where the benefit goes in the opposite direction.
  </p>
  <corollary xml:id="cor_holomorphicweakmaxmin">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f</m> is holomorphic and nonzero in the region <m>G</m>,
        then <m>|f|</m> does not have a strong relative maximum or
        minimum in <m>G</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        By <xref ref="ex_ln_f_harmonic"/>,
        the function <m>\ln|f(z)|</m> is harmonic on <m>G</m> and so,
        by <xref ref="harmonicmaxmin"/>,
        does not have a strong relative maximum or minimum in <m>G</m>.
        But then neither does <m>|f(z)|</m>,
        because <m>\ln</m> is monotonic.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </corollary>
  <p>
    We finish our excursion about harmonic functions with a preview
    and its consequences. 
    We say a real valued function <m>u</m> on a region <m>G</m> has a
    <em>weak relative maximum</em>
    at <m>w</m> if there
    exists a disk <m>D[w,r] \subseteq G</m> such that all 
    <m>z \in D[w,r]</m> satisfy <m>u(z) \leq u(w)</m>.
    <idx><h>maximum</h><h>weak relative</h></idx>
    We define <em>weak relative minimum</em> similarly.
    In <xref ref="taylorchapter"/> we will strengthen
    <xref ref="harmonicmaxmin"/> and
    <xref ref="cor_holomorphicweakmaxmin"/>
    to <xref ref="maxmodthm"/>
    and <xref ref="maxminharmcor"/>
    by replacing <em>strong relative extremum</em>
    in the hypotheses with <em>weak relative extremum</em>.<fn>
      In particular,
      we will show that one does not have to assume that <m>f</m> is
      nonzero in a region <m>G</m> to have a strong relative maximum
      in <m>G</m>. 
    </fn>
    A special but important case of the maximum/minimum principle for
    harmonic functions, 
    <xref ref="maxminharmcor"/>,
    concerns <em>bounded</em> regions.
    In <xref ref="taylorchapter"/> we will establish that,
    if <m>u</m> is harmonic in a bounded region <m>G</m> and
    continuous on its closure, then 
    <men xml:id="eq_minmaxhar">
      \sup_{z \in G} u(z) \ = \ \max_{z \in \partial G} u(z) \qquad
      \text{ and }  \qquad \inf_{z \in G} u(z) \ = \ \min_{z \in \partial
      G} u(z) 
    </men>
    where, as usual, <m>\partial G</m> denotes the boundary
    of <m>G</m>.
    We will exploit this in the next two corollaries.
    <idx><h>boundary</h></idx>
  </p>
  <corollary xml:id="harmoniczeroboundary">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>u</m> is harmonic in the bounded region <m>G</m>
        and continuous on its closure. 
        If <m>u</m> is zero on <m>\partial G</m> then <m>u</m> is zero
        in <m>G</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        By <xref ref="eq_minmaxhar"/>,
        <me>
          u(z) \ \leq \ \sup_{z \in G} u(z) \ = \ \max_{z \in \partial G}
          u(z) \ = \ 0

        and
        <me>
          u(z) \ \geq \ \inf_{z \in G} u(z) \ = \ \min_{z \in \partial G}
          u(z) \ = \ 0 \, 
        </me>,
        so <m>u</m> must be zero in <m>G</m>.

        Suppose <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are harmonic in the bounded

    says that if a function <m>u</m> is harmonic in a bounded region
    <m>G</m> and is continuous on the closure 
    <m>\overline G</m> then the values of <m>u</m> at points in
    <m>G</m> are completely determined by the values of <m>u</m> on
    the boundary of <m>G</m>. 
    We should remark, however,
    that this result is of a completely theoretical nature:
    it says nothing about how to extend a continuous function <m>u</m>
    given on the boundary of a region to be harmonic in the full
    region. 
    This problem is called the <em>Dirichlet<fn>
      Named after Johann Peter Gustav Dirichlet (1805<ndash/>1859).
    </fn>
    problem</em>,
    and it has a solution for all bounded simply-connected regions.
    If the region is the unit disk and <m>u</m> is a continuous
    function on the unit circle, define 
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \hat u \! \left( e^{ i \phi } \right) \ \amp := \ u \! \left( e^{ i \phi } \right) \quad \text{ and } 
          </mrow> 
          <mrow>
            \hat u \! \left( r \, e^{ i \phi } \right) \ \amp := \ \frac{ 1 }{ 2 \pi } \int_0^{ 2 \pi } u \! \left( e^{ i t } \right) P_r(\phi - t) \, \diff{t} \quad \text{ for } \quad r\lt 1\, 
          </mrow> 
        </md>,
    where <m>P_r(\phi)</m> is the Poisson kernel
    which we introduced in <xref ref="ex_poissonkernel"/>.
    <idx><h>Poisson kernel</h></idx>
    Then <m>\hat u</m> is the desired extension:
    it is continuous on the closed unit disk,
    harmonic in the open unit disk,
    and agrees with <m>u</m> on the unit circle.
    In simple cases this solution can be converted to solutions in
    other regions, 
    using a conformal
    map to the unit disk.
    <idx><h>conformal</h></idx>
    All of this is beyond the scope of this book,
    though <xref ref="ex_poissonkernelapp"/>
    gives some indication why the above formula does the trick.
    At any rate,
    we remark that <xref ref="harmonicboundary"/>
    says that the solution to the Dirichlet problem is unique.
