    In <xref ref="geomprop"/>
    we saw that the complex numbers <m>\C</m>,
    which were initially defined algebraically,
    can be identified with the points in the Euclidean plane
    <m>\R^2</m>.
    <idx><h>Euclidean plane</h></idx>
    In this section we collect some definitions and results concerning
    the topology
    of the plane.

    In <xref ref="prop_distance"/>, we interpreted <m>|z - w|</m> as
    the distance between the complex numbers <m>z</m> and <m>w</m>,
    viewed as points in the plane.  So if we fix a complex number
    <m>a</m> and a positive real number <m>r</m>, then all <m>z \in
    \C</m> satisfying <m>\abs{z-a}=r</m> form the set of points at
    distance <m>r</m> from <m>a</m>; that is, this set is the
    <em>circle</em> 
    with center <m>a</m> and
    radius <m>r</m>, which we denote by
    <idx><h>circle</h></idx>
    <me>
      C[a,r] \ := \ \left\{ z \in \C : \, \abs{ z-a } = r \right\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The inside of this circle is called the <em>open disk</em>
    with center <m>a</m> and radius <m>r</m>; we use the notation
    <me>
      D[a,r] \ := \ \left\{z \in \C: \, \abs{z-a}\lt r \right\}
    </me>.

    Note that <m>D[a,r]</m> does not include the points
    on <m>C[a,r]</m>.

  <p>
    Next we need some terminology for talking about subsets of <m>\C</m>.

              of <m>G</m> if every open disk centered at

    The idea is that if you don't move too far from an interior point
    of <m>G</m> then you remain in <m>G</m>; but at a boundary point
    you can make an arbitrarily small move and get to a point inside
    <m>G</m> and you can also make an arbitrarily small move and get

    <statement>
      <p>
        A set is <em>open</em> if all its points are interior points.
        A set is <em>closed</em> if it contains all its boundary points.

  <p>
    One notion that is somewhat subtle in the complex domain is the
    idea of <em>connectedness</em>.
    Intuitively, a set is connected if it is
    <q>in one piece.</q>
    In <m>\R</m> a set is connected if and only if it is an interval,
    so there is little reason to discuss the matter.
    However, in the plane there is a vast variety of connected subsets.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Two sets <m>X, Y \subseteq \C</m> are <em>separated</em>
        if there are disjoint open sets <m>A,B \subset \C</m> so that
        <m>X\subseteq A</m> and <m>Y\subseteq B</m>.
        <idx><h>separated</h></idx>
        
        A set <m>G \subseteq \C</m> is <em>connected</em>
        if it is impossible to find two separated nonempty sets whose
        union is <m>G</m>.
        <idx><h>connected</h></idx>
        A <em>region</em>
        is a connected open set.
        <idx><h>region</h></idx>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The idea of separation is that the two open sets <m>A</m> and
    <m>B</m> ensure that <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> cannot just <q>stick
    together.</q> It is usually easy to check that a set is
    <em>not</em> connected.  On the other hand, it is hard to use the
    above definition to show that a set <em>is</em> connected, since
    we have to rule out any possible separation.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The intervals <m>X=[0,1)</m> and <m>Y=(1,2]</m> on the real
        axis are separated: There are infinitely many choices for
        <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> that work; one choice is <m>A=D[0,1]</m>
        and <m>B=D[2,1]</m>, depicted in <xref ref="fig_separation"/>.
        Hence <m>X \cup Y = 
        [0,2]\setminus\listset1</m> is not
        connected.
      </p>

  <p>
    One type of connected set that we will use frequently is a path.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def_smooth">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <em>path</em>
        (or <em>curve</em>)
        in <m>\C</m> is a continuous function <m>\gg \colon [a,b] \to \C</m>,
        where <m>[a,b]</m> is a closed interval in <m>\R</m>.
        <idx><h>curve</h></idx>
        <idx><h>path</h></idx>
        We may think of <m>\gg</m> as a parametrization of the image
        that is painted by the path and will often write this
        parametrization as <m>\gamma(t), \ a \le t \le b</m>.
        The path is <em>smooth</em>
        if <m>\gg</m> is differentiable and the derivative <m>\gg'</m>
        is continuous and nonzero.
        <idx><h>smooth</h></idx>
        <fn>
        There is a subtlety here,
        because <m>\gg</m> is defined on a closed interval.
        For <m>\gg: [a,b] \to \C</m> to be smooth,
        we demand both that <m>\gg'(t)</m> exists for all <m>a \lt t
        \lt b</m>, and that <m>\lim_{ t \to a^+ } \gg'(t)</m> and
        <m>\lim_{ t \to b^- } \gg'(t)</m> exist. 
        </fn>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This definition uses the calculus notions of continuity and
    differentiability;
    that is, <m>\gg \colon [a,b] \to \C</m> being <em>continuous</em>
    means that for all <m>t_0 \in [a,b]</m>
    <me>
      \lim_{ t \to t_0 } \gg(t) = \gg(t_0) \,
    </me>,
    and the <em>derivative</em> of <m>\gg</m> at <m>t_0</m> is defined by
    <me>
      \gg'(t_0) = \lim_{ t \to t_0 } \frac{ \gg(t) - \gg(t_0) }{ t - t_0 } \,
    </me>.

          \gamma_2(t)=\begin{cases}

    For example,
    the path <m>\gg_1</m> in <xref ref="fig_curves"/> is

      \gg_3(t) = -2 + 2 \, e^{ -it } ,  0 \le t \le \tfrac{ 3 \pi }{ 2 } \,
    </me>,
    even though both <m>\gg_1</m> and <m>\gg_3</m> yield the same picture:
    <m>\gg_1</m> features a counter-clockwise orientation,
    where as that of <m>\gg_3</m> is clockwise.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a customary and practical abuse of notation to use the same
    letter for the path and its parametrization.  We emphasize that a
    path must have a parametrization, and that the parametrization
    must be defined and continuous on a closed and bounded interval
    <m>[a,b]</m>.  Since topologically we may identify <m>\C</m> with
    <m>\R^2</m>, a path can be specified by giving two continuous
    real-valued functions of a real variable, <m>x(t)</m> and
    <m>y(t)</m>, and setting <m>\gg(t) = x(t) + i \, y(t)</m>.

        (in plain English: the path does not cross itself).
        A path <m>\gg: [a,b] \to \C</m> is <em>closed</em>

  <p>
    As seems intuitively clear, any path is connected;
    however, a proof of this fact requires a bit more preparation in
    topology.
    The same goes for the following result,
    which gives a useful property of open connected sets.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="connbysegments">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If any two points in <m>G \subseteq \C</m> can be connected by
        a path in <m>G</m>, then <m>G</m> is connected.  Conversely,
        if <m>G \subseteq \C</m> is open and connected, then any two
        points of <m>G</m> can be connected by a path in <m>G</m>; in
        fact, we can connect any two points of <m>G</m> by a chain of
        horizontal and vertical segments lying in <m>G</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    Here a <em>chain of segments</em>
    in <m>G</m> means the following:
    there are points <m>z_0, z_1, \ldots, z_n</m> so that <m>z_k</m>
    and <m>z_{k+1}</m> are
    the endpoints of a horizontal or vertical segment in <m>G</m>,
    for all <m>k = 0, 1, \dots, n-1</m>.
    <idx><h>chain of segments</h></idx>
    (It is not hard to parametrize such a chain, so it determines a path.)
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the open <em>unit disk</em>
        <m>D[0,1]</m>.
        <idx><h>disk</h><h>unit</h></idx>
        <idx><h>unit disk</h></idx>
        Any two points in <m>D[0,1]</m> can be connected by a chain of
        at most two segments in <m>D[0,1]</m>,
        and so <m>D[0,1]</m> is connected.
        Now let <m>G = D[0,1] \setminus\listset0</m>;
        this is the punctured disk obtained by removing the center
        from <m>D[0,1]</m>.
        Then <m>G</m> is open and it is connected,
        but now you may need more than two segments to connect points.
        For example,
        you need three segments to connect <m>- \frac 1 2</m> to
        <m>\frac 1 2</m> since we cannot go
        through <m>0</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    We remark that the second part of <xref ref="connbysegments"/>
    is not generally true if <m>G</m> is not open.
    For example,
    circles are connected but there is no way to connect two distinct
    points of a circle by a chain of segments that are subsets of the
    circle. 
    A more extreme example, discussed in topology texts, is the
    <q>topologist's sine curve,</q>
    which is a connected set <m>S \subset \C</m> that contains points
    that cannot be connected by a path of any sort
    within <m>S</m>.
