    This is <em>Cauchy's Integral Formula</em>
    for the case that the integration path is a circle;
    we will prove the general statement at the end of this chapter.
    However, already this special case is worth meditating over:
    the data on the right-hand side of
    <xref ref="cauchyformulacircle"/>
    is entirely given by the values that <m>f(z)</m> takes on for
    <m>z</m> on the circle <m>C[w,R]</m>. 
    Thus Cauchy's Integral Formula says that this data determines
    <m>f(w)</m>. 
    This has the flavor of <em>mean-value theorems</em>,
    which the following corollary makes even more apparent.

  <proof>
    <p>
      By assumption,
      <m>f</m> is holomorphic in an open set <m>G</m> that contains
      <m>\overline D[w,R]</m>, 
      and so <m>\frac{ f(z) }{ z-w }</m> is holomorphic in <m>H := G
      \setminus \{ w \}</m>. 
      For any <m>0 \lt  r \lt  R</m>,
      <me>
        C[w,r] \sim_H C[w,R] \,
      </me>,
      and so Cauchy's <xref ref="cauchythm"/>
      and <xref ref="ex_circleint"/> give

        <mrow>\amp \left| \int_{C[w,R]} \frac{ f(z) }{ z-w } \, \diff{z} -

        <mrow> \amp \qquad = \ \left| \int_{C[w,r]} \frac{

    <p>
      Here the inequality comes from
      <xref ref="intprop"/> <xref ref="int4"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let <m>\epsilon > 0</m>.
      Because <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>w</m>,
      there exists <m>\delta > 0</m> such that <m>|z-w| \lt
      \delta</m> implies 
      <me>
        \left| f(z) - f(w) \right| \ \lt  \ \frac \epsilon {2 \pi} \,
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular,
      this will hold for <m>z \in C[w, \frac \delta 2]</m>,
      and so <xref ref="eq_cifestimate"/> implies,
      with <m>r = \frac \delta 2</m>,
      <me>
        \left| \int_{C[w,R]} \frac{ f(z) }{ z-w } \, \diff{z} - 2 \pi
        i \, f(w) \right| \ \lt  \ \epsilon \, 
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we can choose <m>\epsilon</m> as small as we'd like,
      the left-hand side must be zero,
      which proves <xref ref="cauchyformulacircle"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="meanvalue"/>
      now follows by definition of the complex integral:
      <me>
        f(w) \ = \ \frac 1 {2 \pi i} \int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{ f \left( w
        + R \, e^{it} \right) }{ w + R \, e^{it} - w } \, i R \,
        e^{it} \, \diff{t} \ = \ \frac 1 {2 \pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} f
        \left( w + R \, e^{it} \right) \diff{t} \, 
      </me>,
      which splits into real and imaginary parts as
      <me>
        u(w) + i \, v(w) \ = \ \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} u \left(
        w + R \, e^{it}\right) \diff{t} \ + \ i \, \frac 1 {2 \pi}
        \int_0^{2 \pi} v \left( w + R \, e^{it} \right) \diff{t} \,
        . 
      </me>
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    <xref ref="cauchyformulacircle">Theorem</xref>
    can be used to compute integrals of a certain nature.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="exam_cif">
    <statement>
      <p>
        We'd like to determine
        <me>
          \int_{ C[i,1] } \frac{ \diff{z} }{ z^2 + 1 } \,
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The function <m>f(z) = \frac{ 1 }{ z+i }</m> is holomorphic in
        <m>\C \setminus \{ -i \}</m>, 
        which contains <m>\overline D[i,1]</m>.
        Thus we can apply <xref ref="cauchyformulacircle"/>:
        <me>
          \int_{ C[i,1] } \frac{ \diff{z} }{ z^2 + 1 } \ = \ \int_{
          C[i,1] } \frac{ \frac{ 1 }{ z+i } }{ z-i } \, \diff{z} \ = \ 2

  <p>
    Now we would like to extend <xref ref="cauchyformulacircle"/>
    by replacing <m>C[w,R]</m> with any simple closed piecewise smooth
    path <m>\gg</m> around <m>w</m>. 
    Intuitively, Cauchy's <xref ref="cauchythm">Theorem</xref>
    should supply such an extension:
    assuming that <m>f</m> is holomorphic in a region <m>G</m> that
    includes <m>\gg</m> and its inside, 
    we can find a small <m>R</m> such that <m>\overline D[w,R]
    \subseteq G</m>, 
    and since <m>\frac{ f(z) }{ z-w }</m> is holomorphic in
    <m>H := G \setminus \{ w \}</m> and <m>\gg \sim_H C[w,R]</m>,
    <xref ref="cauchythm"/>
    and <xref ref="cauchyformulacircle"/> yield
    <me>
      f(w) \ = \ \frac 1 {2 \pi i} \int_\gg \frac{ f(z) }{ z-w } \,
      \diff{z} \, 
    </me>.

    This all smells like good coffee,
    except<nbsp/>... we might be just dreaming.
    <idx><h>coffee</h></idx>
    The argument may be intuitively clear,
    but intuition doesn't prove anything.
    We'll look at it carefully,
    fill in the gaps, and then we'll see what we have proved.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, we need a notion of the <em>inside</em> of a simple closed path.
    The fact that any such path <m>\gg</m> divides the complex plane
    into two connected open sets of <m>\gg</m> (the bounded one of
    which we call the <em>inside </em>
    or <em>interior</em> of <m>\gg</m>)
    is one of the first substantial theorems ever proved in topology,
    the <em>Jordan Curve Theorem</em>,
    due to Camille Jordan (1838<ndash/>1922).
    <idx><h>inside</h></idx>
    <idx><h>path</h><h>inside of</h></idx>
    <idx><h>path</h><h>interior of</h></idx>
    <idx><h>topology</h></idx>
    <idx><h>Jordan curve theorem</h></idx>
    <fn>
      This is the Jordan of <em>Jordan normal form</em> fame,
      but not the one of <em>Gau&#223;<ndash/>Jordan elimination</em>.
    </fn>
    In this book we shall assume the validity of the Jordan
    Curve Theorem. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, we need to specify the orientation of <m>\gg</m>,
    since if the formula gives <m>f(w)</m> for one orientation then it
    will give <m>-f(w)</m> for the other orientation. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A piecewise smooth simple closed path <m>\gg</m> is
        <em>positively oriented</em>
        if it is parametrized so that its inside is on the left as our
        parametrization traverses<nbsp/><m>\gamma</m>. 
        An example is a counter-clockwise oriented circle.
        <idx><h>path</h><h>positively oriented</h></idx>
        <idx><h>positive orientation</h></idx>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Third, if <m>\gg</m> is positively oriented and
    <m>\overline D[w,R]</m> is a closed disk inside <m>\gg</m> then we
    need a homotopy from <m>\gg</m> to the counterclockwise circle
    <m>C[w,R]</m> that stays inside <m>\gg</m> and away from
    <m>D[w,R]</m>. 
    This is provided directly by another substantial theorem of topology,
    the <em>Annulus Theorem</em>,
    although there are other methods.
    Again, in this book we shall assume the existence of this homotopy.
  </p>
  <p>
    These results of topology seem intuitively obvious but are
    surprisingly difficult to prove. 
    If you'd like to see a proof,
    we recommend that you take a course in topology.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is yet another subtle problem.
    We assumed that <m>\gg</m> is in <m>G</m>,
    but we also need the <em>interior</em>
    of <m>\gg</m> to be contained in <m>G</m>,
    since we need to apply Cauchy's Theorem to the homotopy between
    <m>\gg</m> and <m>C[w,R]</m>. 
    We could just add this as an assumption to our theorem,
    but the following formulation will be more convenient later.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="cauchyformula">
    <title>Cauchy's Integral Formula</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>f</m> is holomorphic in the region <m>G</m> and
        <m>\gg</m> is a positively oriented, 
        simple, closed, piecewise smooth path,
        such that <m>w</m> is inside <m>\gg</m> and <m>\gg \sim_G 0</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          f(w) \ = \ \frac 1 {2 \pi i} \int_\gg \frac{ f(z) }{ z-w } \,
          \diff{z} \, 
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    So all that we need to finish the proof of
    <xref ref="cauchyformula"/>
    is one more fact from topology.
    But we can prove this one:
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="simpleContractible">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>\gg</m> is a simple,
        closed, piecewise smooth path in the region <m>G</m>.
        Then <m>G</m> contains the interior of <m>\gg</m> if and only
        if <m>\gg\sim_G0</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      One direction is easy: If <m>G</m> contains the interior of
      <m>\gg</m> and 
      <m>\overline D[w,R]</m> is any closed disk in the interior of
      <m>\gg</m> then there is a <m>G</m>-homotopy from <m>\gg</m> to
      <m>C[w,R]</m>, 
      and <m>C[w,R] \sim_G 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the other direction, we argue by contradiction: Assume
      <m>\gg\sim_G0</m> but <m>G</m> does not contain the interior of
      <m>\gg</m>. 
      So we can find a point <m>w</m> in the interior of <m>\gg</m>
      which is not in <m>G</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Define <m>g(z)=\frac1{z-w}</m> for <m>z\ne w</m>.
      Now <m>g</m> is holomorphic on <m>G</m> and <m>\gg\sim_G0</m>,
      so <xref ref="cauchycor"/> applies,
      and we have <m>\int_\gg g(z)\,\diff{z} = 0</m>.
      On the other hand, choose <m>R>0</m> so that
      <m>\overline D[w,R]</m> is inside <m>\gg</m>.
      There is a homotopy in <m>\C\setminus \{\,w\,\}</m> from
      <m>\gg</m> to <m>C[w,R]</m>, 
      so Cauchy's <xref ref="cauchythm"/>,
      plus <xref ref="ex_circleint"/>,
      shows that <m>\int_\gg g(z)\,\diff{z} = 2\pi i</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This contradiction finishes the proof.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    Notice that,
    instead of using topology to prove a theorem about holomorphic
    functions, 
    we just used holomorphic functions to prove a theorem about
    topology.
