      We will now spend a short while on certain functions defined on
      subsets of the complex plane that are <em>real</em> valued, 
      namely those functions that are harmonic in some region.
      The main motivation for studying harmonic functions is that the
      partial differential equation they satisfy is very common in the
      physical sciences. 
      Their definition briefly showed its face in
      <xref ref="functionchapter"/>,
      but we study them only now in more detail,
      since we have more machinery at our disposal.
      This machinery comes from <em>complex</em>-valued functions,
      which are, nevertheless, intimately connected to harmonic
      functions.
