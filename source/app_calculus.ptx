    Here we collect a few theorems from real calculus that we
    make use of in the course of the text.

    <statement>
      <p>Suppose <m>K \subset \R^n</m> is closed and bounded and

    Many of the most important results of analysis concern
    combinations of limit 
    operations.  The most important of all calculus theorems combines 
    differentiation and integration (in two ways):

      <p>
        Suppose <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b] \times [c,d]

  <p>
    Leibniz's Rule follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
    (<xref ref="fundthmcalc"/>). You can try to prove it, e.g., as
    follows: Define <m>F(x)=\int_c^d f(x,y)\,\diff{y}</m>,
    get an expression
    for <m>F(x)-F(a)</m>
    as an iterated integral by writing <m>f(x,y)-f(a,y)</m>
    as
    the integral of <m>\fderiv fx</m>, interchange the order of
    integrations, and then diafferentiate using

    <statement>
      <p>Suppose <m>I\subset\R</m> is an open interval and either
      <m>c</m> is in <m>I</m> or <m>c</m>

  <p>
    There are many extensions of L'H&#xf4;spital's rule.  In particular, the rule
    remains true if any of the following changes are made:
    <ul>
      <li><p><m>L</m> is infinite..</p></li>
      <li><p><m>I</m> is unbounded and <m>c</m> is an infinite
      endpoint of <m>I</m>. </p></li>
      <li><p><m>\lim_{x\to c}f(x)</m> and <m>\lim_{x\to c}g(x)</m> are
      both infinite.
