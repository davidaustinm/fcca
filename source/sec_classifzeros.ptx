  <title>Classification of Zeros and the Identity Principle</title>
  <p>
    When we proved the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
    (<xref ref="fundthmalg"/>;
    see also <xref ref="fta"/>),
    we remarked that,
    if a polynomial <m>p(z)</m> of degree <m>d>0</m> has a zero at
    <m>a</m> (that is, 
    <m>p(a) = 0</m>), then <m>p(z)</m> has <m>z-a</m> as a factor.
    That is, we can write <m>p(z)=(z-a) \, q(z)</m> where <m>q(z)</m>
    is a polynomial of degree <m>d-1</m>. 
    We can then ask whether <m>q(z)</m> itself has a zero at <m>a</m>
    and, if so, 
    we can factor out another <m>(z-a)</m>.
    Continuing in this way, we see that we can factor <m>p(z)</m> as
    <me>
      p(z) \ = \ (z-a)^m \, g(z)
    </me>
    where <m>m</m> is a positive integer <m>\le d</m> and <m>g(z)</m>
    is a polynomial that does not have a zero at <m>a</m>. 
    The integer <m>m</m> is called the <em>multiplicity</em>
    of the zero <m>a</m> of <m>p(z)</m>.
    Almost exactly the same thing happens for holomorphic functions.

  <theorem xml:id="classificationzeros">
    <title>Classification of Zeros</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>f: G \to \C</m> is holomorphic and <m>f</m> has a
        zero at <m>a \in G</m>. 
        Then either
        <ol marker="a) ">
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f</m> is identically zero on some open disk <m>D</m>
              centered at <m>a</m> (that is, 
              <m>f(z)=0</m> for all <m>z \in D</m>); or
            </p>
          </li>
          <li xml:id="classificationzeros_isolated">
            <p>
              there exist a positive integer <m>m</m> and a
              holomorphic function <m>g: G \to \C</m>, 
              such that <m>g(a)\ne0</m> and
              <me>
                f(z) \ = \ (z-a)^m \, g(z) \qquad \text{ for all }  z \in G \,
              </me>.
              In this case the zero <m>a</m> is isolated:
              there is a disk <m>D[a,r]</m> which contains no other
              zero of <m>f</m>. 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        The integer <m>m</m> in the second case is uniquely determined
        by <m>f</m> and <m>a</m> and is called the
        <em>multiplicity</em> 
        of the zero at <m>a</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        By <xref ref="thm_holomorphicpower"/>,
        there exists <m>R>0</m> such that we can expand
        <me>
          f(z) \ = \ \sum_{k\ge0}c_k (z-a)^k \qquad \text{ for }  z \in
          D[a,R] \, 
        </me>,
        and <m>c_0 = f(a) = 0</m>.
        There are now exactly two possibilities: either
        <ol marker="a) ">
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>c_k=0</m> for all <m>k \ge 0</m>; or
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              there is some positive integer <m>m</m> so that
              <m>c_k=0</m> for all <m>k\lt m</m> but <m>c_m\ne0</m>. 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        The first case gives <m>f(z) =0</m> for all <m>z \in D[a,R]</m>.
        So now consider the second case.
        We note that for <m>z \in D[a,R]</m>,
        <md>
          <mrow>f(z) \amp \ = \ c_m(z-a)^m + c_{m+1}(z-a)^{m+1} + \cdots \ = \
          (z-a)^m\left( c_m+c_{m+1}(z-a) + \cdots\right)</mrow> 
          <mrow>\amp \ = \ (z-a)^m\sum_{k\ge0}c_{k+m} \, (z-a)^k</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus we can define a function <m>g: G \to \C</m> through
        <me>
        g(z) := \begin{cases}\ds \sum_{k\ge0}c_{k+m}(z-a)^k \amp
        \text{ if }  z \in D[a,R] \, , \\ \dfrac{f(z)}{(z-a)^m} \amp
        \text{ if } z\in G\setminus \listset a . \end{cases} 
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        (According to our calculations above,
        the two definitions give the same value when
        <m>z \in D[a,R] \setminus \listset a</m>.) The function
        <m>g</m> is holomorphic in <m>D[a,R]</m> by the first
        definition, 
        and <m>g</m> is holomorphic in
        <m>G \setminus \listset a</m> by the second definition.
        Note that <m>g(a)=c_m\ne0</m> and, by construction,
        <me>
          f(z) \ = \ (z-a)^m \, g(z) \qquad \text{ for all }  z \in G \,
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>g(a)\ne0</m> there is, by continuity,
        <m>r>0</m> so that <m>g(z)\ne0</m> for all <m>z\in D[a,r]</m>,
        so <m>D[a,r]</m> contains no other zero of <m>f</m>.
        The integer <m>m</m> is unique,
        since it is defined in terms of the power series expansion of
        <m>f</m> at <m>a</m>, 
        which is unique by <xref ref="uniqueness"/>.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    <xref ref="classificationzeros"/>
    gives rise to the following result,
    which is sometimes called the <em>identity principle</em>
    or the <em>uniqueness theorem</em>.

  <theorem xml:id="uniquenessfunction">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>G</m> is a region,
        <m>f: G \to \C</m> is holomorphic,
        and <m>f(a_n) = 0</m> where <m>(a_n)</m> is a sequence of
        distinct numbers that converges in <m>G</m>. 
        Then <m>f</m> is the zero function on <m>G</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    Applying this theorem to the difference of two functions
    immediately gives the following variant.
  </p>
  <corollary xml:id="cor_uniquenessfunction">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are holomorphic in a region <m>G</m> and

        G</m> with <m>a_k\ne w</m> for all <m>k</m>. 
        Then <m>f(z)=g(z)</m> for all <m>z</m> in <m>G</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Consider the following two subsets of <m>G</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>X \amp := \left\{ a \in G : \text{ there exists }  r
          \text{ such that }  f(z) = 0 \text{ for all }  z \in D[a,r]

          <mrow>Y \amp := \left\{ a \in G : \text{ there exists }  r
          \text{ such that }  f(z) \ne 0 \text{ for all }  z \in
          D[a,r] \setminus \{ a \} \right\} </mrow> 
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>f(a) \ne 0</m> then, by continuity of <m>f</m>,
        there exists a disk centered at <m>a</m> in which <m>f</m> is nonzero,
        and so <m>a \in Y</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>f(a) = 0</m>,
        then <xref ref="classificationzeros"/>
        says that either <m>a \in X</m> or <m>a</m> is an isolated
        zero of <m>f</m>, 
        so <m>a\in Y</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have thus proved that <m>G</m> is the disjoint union of
        <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>. 
        <xref ref="prob_uniquenessfunctionopensets"/>
        proves that <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are open, and so
        (because <m>G</m> is a region)
        either <m>X</m> or <m>Y</m> has to be empty.
        The conditions of <xref ref="uniquenessfunction"/>
        say that <m>\lim_{ n \to \infty } a_n</m> is not in <m>Y</m>,
        and thus it has to be in <m>X</m>.
        Thus <m>G = X</m> and the statement of
        <xref ref="uniquenessfunction"/> follows.

    The identity principle yields the strengthenings of
    <xref ref="harmonicmaxmin"/>
    and <xref ref="cor_holomorphicweakmaxmin"/>
    promised in <xref ref="harmonicChapter"/>.
    We recall that that we say the function <m>u: G \to \R</m> has a
    <em>weak relative maximum</em>
    <m>w</m> if there exists a disk <m>D[w,r] \subseteq G</m> such that all

  <p>
    There are many reformulations of this theorem, such as:
  </p>
  <corollary xml:id="maxOnBoundary">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>f</m> is holomorphic in a bounded region <m>G</m>
        and continuous on its closure. 
        Then
        <me>
          \sup_{ z \in G } |f(z)| \ = \ \max_{ z \in \partial G } |f(z)| \,
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        This is trivial if <m>f</m> is constant,
        so we assume <m>f</m> is non-constant.
        By the Extreme Value <xref ref="realEVT"/>
        there is a point <m>z_0\in\overline G</m> so that
        <m>\max_{z\in\overline G}|f(z)| = |f(z_0)|</m>. 
        Clearly <m>\sup_{ z \in G } |f(z)| \le \max_{ z \in\overline G
        } |f(z)|</m>, 
        and this is easily seen to be an equality using continuity at
        <m>z_0</m>, 
        since there are points of <m>G</m> arbitrarily close to <m>z_0</m>.
        Finally, <xref ref="maxmodthm"/> implies <m>z_0\not\in G</m>,
        so <m>z_0</m> must be in <m>\partial G</m>.

  <p>
    Note that <xref ref="eq_minmaxhar"/> in <xref ref="harmonicChapter"/>
    follows from <xref ref="maxminharmcor"/>
    using essentially the same argument as in the proof of
    <xref ref="maxOnBoundary"/>.
  </p>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose there exist <m>a \in G</m> and <m>R > 0</m> such that
      <m>|f(a)| \ge |f(z)|</m> for all <m>z \in D[a,R]</m>.
      We will show that then <m>f</m> is constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>f(a)=0</m> then <m>f(z)=0</m> for all <m>z \in D[a,R]</m>,
      so <m>f</m> is identically zero by <xref ref="uniquenessfunction"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now assume <m>f(a)\ne0</m>,
      which allows us to define the holomorphic function
      <m>g: G \to \C</m> via <m>g(z) := \frac{ f(z) }{ f(a) }</m>.
      This function satisfies
      <me>
        \abs{g(z)} \ \le  \ \abs{g(a)} \ = \ 1 \qquad \text{ for all }
        z \in D[a,R] \, 
      </me>,
    </p>
    <p>
      Also <m>g(a)=1</m>, so, by continuity of <m>g</m>,
      we can find <m>r \le R</m> such that
      <m>\Re(g(z)) > 0</m> for <m>z \in D[a,r]</m>.
      This allows us, in turn,
      to define the holomorphic function
      <m>h: D[a,r] \to \C</m> through <m>h(z) := \Log(g(z))</m>,
      which satisfies
      <me>
        h(a) \ = \ \Log(g(a)) \ = \ \Log(1) \ = \ 0
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        \Re(h(z)) \ = \ \Re(\Log(g(z))) \ = \ \ln(\abs{g(z)}) \ \le \ \ln(1)
        \ = \ 0 \, 
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="ex_realmax0"/>
      now implies that <m>h</m> must be identically zero in
      <m>D[a,r]</m>. 
      Hence <m>g(z)=\exp(h(z))</m> must be equal to
      <m>\exp(0)=1</m> for all <m>z \in D[a,r]</m>,
      and so <m>f(z)=f(a) \, g(z)</m> must have the constant value
      <m>f(a)</m> for all <m>z \in D[a,r]</m>. 
      <xref ref="cor_uniquenessfunction"/>
      then implies that <m>f</m> is constant in <m>G</m>.
