  <title>Constant Functions</title>
  <p>
    As a sample application of the definition of the derivative of a
    complex function,
    we consider functions that have a derivative of <m>0</m>.
    In a typical calculus course,
    one of the first applications of the Mean-Value Theorem for
    real-valued functions 
    (<xref ref="realmeanvalue"/>)
    is to show that if a function has zero derivative everywhere on an
    interval then it must be constant. 
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="lem_constant">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>I</m> is an interval and
        <m>f: I \to \R</m> is a real-valued function with <m>f'(x)</m>
        defined and equal to <m>0</m> for all <m>x \in I</m>, 
        then there is a constant <m>c \in \R</m> such that
        <m>f(x) = c</m> for all <m>x \in I</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      The Mean-Value <xref ref="realmeanvalue"/>
      says that for any <m>x, y \in I</m>,
      <me>
        f(y)-f(x) \ = \ f'\bigl(x + a(y-x) \bigr) (y-x)
      </me>
      for some <m>0 \lt  a \lt  1</m>.
      Now <m>f'(x+a(y-x))=0</m>, so the above equation yields
      <m>f(y)=f(x)</m>. 
      Since this is true for any <m>x, y \in I</m>,
      the function <m>f</m> must be constant on<nbsp/><m>I</m>. 
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    We do not (yet) have a complex version of the Mean-Value Theorem,
    and so we will use a different argument to prove that a complex
    function whose derivative is always <m>0</m> must be constant. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Our proof of <xref ref="lem_constant"/>
    required two key features of the function <m>f</m>,
    both of which are somewhat obviously necessary.
    The first is that <m>f</m> be differentiable everywhere in its
    domain. 
    In fact, if <m>f</m> is not differentiable everywhere,
    we can construct functions that have zero derivative almost
    everywhere but that have infinitely many values in their image. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The second key feature is that the interval <m>I</m> is connected.
    It is certainly important for the domain to be connected in both
    the real and complex cases. 
    For instance,
    if we define the function <m>f: \{ x+iy \in \C : x \ne 0 \} \to
    \C</m> through 
    <me>
      f(z) := \begin{cases}1\amp  \text{ if } \Re z > 0, \\ 2\amp
      \text{ if } \Re z \lt 0, \end{cases} 
    </me>
    then <m>f'(z)=0</m> for all <m>z</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>,
    but <m>f</m> is not constant.
    This may seem like a silly example,
    but it illustrates a pitfall to proving a function is constant
    that we must be careful of. 
    Recall that a <em>region</em> of <m>\C</m> is an open connected subset.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="derivative0">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>G\subseteq\C</m> is a region and
        <m>f: G \to \C</m> is a complex-valued function with <m>f'(z)</m> defined and equal to <m>0</m> for all <m>z \in G</m>,
        then <m>f</m> is constant.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We will first show that <m>f</m> is constant along horizontal
      segments and along vertical segments in <m>G</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that <m>H</m> is a horizontal line segment in <m>G</m>.
      Thus there is some number <m>y_0 \in \R</m> such that the
      imaginary part of any <m>z \in H</m> is <m>\Im(z) = y_0</m>. 
      Now consider the real part <m>u(z)</m> of the function <m>f(z)</m>,
      for <m>z \in H</m>.
      Since <m>\Im(z) = y_0</m> is constant on <m>H</m>,
      we can consider <m>u(z) = u(x,y_0)</m> to be just a function of
      <m>x</m>, 
      the real part of <m>z = x + iy_0</m>.
      By assumption, <m>f'(z) = 0</m>,
      so for <m>z \in H</m> we have <m>u_x(z) = \Re(f'(z)) = 0</m>.
      Thus, by <xref ref="lem_constant">Proposition</xref>,
      <m>u(z)</m> is constant on <m>H</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can argue the same way to see that the imaginary part
      <m>v(z)</m> of <m>f(z)</m> is constant on <m>H</m>, 
      since <m>v_x(z) = \Im(f'(z))=0</m> on <m>H</m>.
      Since both the real and imaginary parts of <m>f(z)</m> are
      constant on <m>H</m>, 
      the function <m>f(z)</m> itself is constant on <m>H</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This same argument works for vertical segments,
      interchanging the roles of the real and imaginary parts.
      We have thus proved that <m>f</m> is constant along horizontal
      segments and along vertical segments in <m>G</m>. 
      Now if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are two points in <m>G</m> that can
      be connected by a path composed of horizontal and vertical
      segments, 
      we conclude that <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>.
      But any two points of a region may be connected by finitely many
      such segments by <xref ref="connbysegments">Theorem</xref>, 
      so <m>f</m> has the same value at any two points of <m>G</m>,
      thus proving the theorem.

    There are a number of surprising applications of <xref
