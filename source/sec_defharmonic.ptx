  <p>
    Recall from <xref ref="sec_Cauchy-Riemann"/>
    the definition of a harmonic function:
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G \subseteq \C</m> be a region.
        A function <m>u: G \to \R</m> is <em>harmonic</em>
        in <m>G</m> if it has continuous second partials in <m>G</m>
        and satisfies the <em>Laplace

  <example xml:id="exam_xyharmonic">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The function <m>u(x,y) = xy</m> is harmonic in <m>\C</m> since

        The function <m>u(x,y) = e^x \cos(y)</m> is harmonic in

    There are (at least) two reasons why harmonic functions are part
    of the study of complex analysis,

  <proposition xml:id="reimharmonic">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>f=u+iv</m> is holomorphic in the region <m>G</m>.
        Then <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are harmonic in<nbsp/><m>G</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        First, by <xref ref="infdiff">Corollary</xref>,
        <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> have continuous second partials.
        By <xref ref="cre">Theorem</xref>,
        <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> satisfy the Cauchy<ndash/>Riemann
        equations<nbsp/><xref ref="crequations"/> 
        <me>
          u_x = v_y \qquad \text{ and }  \qquad u_y = - v_x
        </me>
        in <m>G</m>.
        Hence we can repeat our argumentation in
        <xref ref="eq_firstharmonicinstance"/>, 
        <me>
          u_{xx} + u_{yy} \ = \ \left( u_x \right)_x + \left( u_y
          \right)_y \ = \ \left( v_y \right)_x + \left( -v_x \right)_y \ = \
          v_{yx} - v_{xy} \ = \ 0 \, 
          </me>.
        Note that in the last step we used the fact that <m>v</m> has
        continuous second partials. 
        The proof that <m>v</m> satisfies the Laplace equation is
        practically identical. 
      </p>
    </proof>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    <xref ref="reimharmonic"/>
    gives us an effective way to show that certain functions are
    harmonic in <m>G</m> by way of constructing an accompanying
    holomorphic function on<nbsp/><m>G</m>. 
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Revisiting <xref ref="exam_xyharmonic"/>,
        we can see that <m>u(x,y) = xy</m> is harmonic in <m>\C</m>
        also by noticing that 
        <me>
          f(z) \ = \ \tfrac 1 2 \, z^2 \ = \ \tfrac 1 2 \left( x^2 - y^2
          \right) + i xy 
        </me>
        is entire and <m>\Im(f) = u</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A second reason that the function
        <m>u(x,y) = e^x \cos(y)</m> from
        <xref ref="exam_excosyharmonic"/>
        is harmonic in <m>\C</m> is that
        <me>
          f(z) \ = \ \exp(z) \ = \ e^x \cos(y) + i \, e^x \sin(y)
        </me>
        is entire and <m>\Re(f) = u</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    <xref ref="reimharmonic"/>
    practically shouts for a converse.
    There are, however,
    functions that are harmonic in a region <m>G</m> but not the real
    part (say) of a holomorphic function in <m>G</m> 
    (<xref ref="logharmonic"/>).
    We do obtain a converse of <xref ref="reimharmonic"/>
    if we restrict ourselves to <em>simply-connected</em> regions.

  <theorem xml:id="harmonictoholomorphic">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>u</m> is harmonic on a simply-connected region
        <m>G</m>.  Then there exists a harmonic function <m>v</m> in
        <m>G</m> such that <m>f=u+iv</m> is holomorphic
        in <m>G</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    The function <m>v</m> is called a <em>harmonic conjugate</em>
    of<nbsp/><m>u</m>.
    <idx><h>harmonic conjugate</h></idx>
  </p>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We will explicitly construct a holomorphic function <m>f</m>
      (and thus <m>v = \Im f</m>).
      First, let
      <me>
        g \ := \ u_x - i \, u_y \,
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan is to prove that <m>g</m> is holomorphic,
      and then to construct an antiderivative of <m>g</m>,
      which will be almost the function <m>f</m> that we're after.
      To prove that <m>g</m> is holomorphic,
      we use <xref ref="cre">Theorem</xref>:
      first because <m>u</m> is harmonic,
      <m>\Re g = u_x</m> and <m>\Im g = - u_y</m> have continuous
      partials. 
      Moreover, again because <m>u</m> is harmonic,
      <m>\Re g</m> and <m>\Im g</m> satisfy the Cauchy<ndash/>Riemann
      equations<nbsp/><xref ref="crequations"/>: 
      <me>
        \left( \Re g \right)_x \ = \ u_{xx} \ = \ - u_{yy} \ = \ \left( \Im g
        \right)_y 
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        \left( \Re g \right)_y \ = \ u_{xy} \ = \ u_{yx} \ = \ - \left( \Im g
        \right)_x \, 
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="cre"/> implies that <m>g</m> is holomorphic in <m>G</m>,
      and so we can use <xref ref="cor_simplyconnectedprimitive"/>
      to obtain an antiderivative <m>h</m> of <m>g</m> on <m>G</m>
      (here is where we use the fact that <m>G</m> is simply connected).
      Now we decompose <m>h</m> into its real and imaginary parts as
      <m>h=a+ib</m>. 
      Then, again using <xref ref="cre"/>,
      <me>
        g \ = \ h' \ = \ a_x + i \, b_x \ = \ a_x - i \, a_y \,
      </me>.
      (The second equation follows from the Cauchy<ndash/>Riemann
      equations <xref ref="crequations"/>.) But the real part of
      <m>g</m> is <m>u_x</m>, 
      so we obtain <m>u_x = a_x</m> and thus
      <m>u(x,y) = a(x,y) + c(y)</m> for some function <m>c</m> that
      depends only on <m>y</m>. 
      On the other hand,
      comparing the imaginary parts of <m>g</m> and <m>h'</m> yields
      <m>-u_y = -a_y</m> and so 
      <m>u(x,y) = a(x,y) + c(x)</m> where <m>c</m> depends only on <m>x</m>.
      Hence <m>c</m> has to be constant,
      and <m>u(x,y)=a(x,y)+c</m>.
      But then
      <me>
        f(z) \ := \ h(z) + c
      </me>
      is a function holomorphic in <m>G</m> whose real part is <m>u</m>,
      as promised.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    As a side remark,
    with hindsight it should not be surprising that the function
    <m>g</m> that we first constructed in our proof is the derivative
    of the sought-after function <m>f</m>. 
    Namely, by <xref ref="cre"/>
    such a function <m>f=u+iv</m> must satisfy
    <me>
      f' \ = \ u_x + i \, v_x \ = \ u_x - i \, u_y \,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    (The second equation follows from the Cauchy<ndash/>Riemann
    equations
    <xref ref="crequations"/>.) It is also worth mentioning that our
    proof of <xref ref="harmonictoholomorphic"/> 
    shows that if <m>u</m> is harmonic in <m>G</m>,
    then <m>u_x</m> is the real part of the function <m>g=u_x-iu_y</m>,
    which is holomorphic in <m>G</m>
    <em>regardless of whether <m>G</m> is simply connected or not</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As our proof of <xref ref="harmonictoholomorphic"/> is constructive,
    we can use it to produce harmonic conjugates.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Revisiting <xref ref="exam_xyharmonic"/> for the second time,
        we can construct a harmonic conjugate of
        <m>u(x,y) = xy</m> along the lines of our proof of
        <xref ref="harmonictoholomorphic"/>:
        first let
        <me>
          g \ := \ u_x - i \, u_y \ = \   y - i \, x \ = \  -i \, z
        </me>
        which has antiderivative
        <me>
          h(z) \ = \ - \tfrac i 2 \, z^2 \ = \ xy - \tfrac i 2 \left( x^2 -
          y^2 \right) 
        </me>
        whose real part is <m>u</m> and whose imaginary part
        <me>
          v(x,y) \ := \ - \tfrac 1 2 \left( x^2 - y^2 \right)
        </me>
        gives a harmonic conjugate for<nbsp/><m>u</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

        u = x*y
        diff(u,x) - i*diff(u,y)

    We can give a more practical machinery for computing harmonic conjugates,
    which only depends on computing certain (calculus) integrals;
    thus this can be easily applied, e.g., to polynomials.
    We state it for functions that are harmonic in the whole complex plane,
    but you can easily adjust it to functions that are harmonic on
    certain subsets of <m>\C</m>.<fn>

    As you might imagine, <xref ref="reimharmonic"/>
    and <xref ref="harmonictoholomorphic"/>
    allow for a powerful interplay between harmonic and holomorphic
    functions. 
    In that spirit, the following theorem appears not too surprising.
    You might appreciate its depth better when looking back at the
    simple definition of a harmonic function. 
  </p>
  <corollary xml:id="cor_harmonicinfdiff">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A harmonic function is infinitely differentiable.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>u</m> is harmonic in <m>G</m> and <m>z_0 \in G</m>.
        We will show that <m>u^{ (n) } (z_0)</m> exists for all
        positive integers <m>n</m>. 
        Let <m>r>0</m> such that the disk
        <m>D[z_0,r]</m> is contained in <m>G</m>.
        Since <m>D[z_0,r]</m> is simply connected,
        <xref ref="harmonictoholomorphic"/>
        asserts the existence of a holomorphic function <m>f</m> in
        <m>D[z_0,r]</m> such that <m>u = \Re f</m> on <m>D[z_0,r]</m>.
        By <xref ref="infdiff"/>,
        <m>f</m> is infinitely differentiable on <m>D[z_0,r]</m>,
        and hence so is its real part<nbsp/><m>u</m>.
      </p>
  </proof>
  </corollary>
  <p>
    This proof is the first in a series of proofs that uses the fact
    that the property of being harmonic is 
    <em>local</em><mdash/>it is a property at each point of a certain region.
    Note that in our proof of <xref ref="cor_harmonicinfdiff"/>
    we did not construct a function <m>f</m> that is holomorphic in <m>G</m>;
    we only constructed such a function on the disk <m>D[z_0,r]</m>.
    This <m>f</m> might very well differ from one disk to the next.
