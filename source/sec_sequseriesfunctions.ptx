        Let <m>G \subseteq \C</m> and <m>f_n : G \to \C</m> for <m>n
        \ge 1</m>. 
        We say that <m>(f_n)</m> <em>converges pointwise</em>
        to <m>f: G \to \C</m> if for each <m>z \in G</m>,
        <me>
          \lim_{ n \to \infty } f_n(z) \= f(z) \,
        </me>.

      <p>
        We say that <m>(f_n)</m> <em>converges uniformly</em>
        to <m>f: G \to \C</m> if for all
        <m>\epsilon>0</m> there is an <m>N</m> such that for all <m>z
        \in G</m> and for all 
        <m>n \geq N</m>
        <me>
          \left| f_n(z) - f(z) \right| \ \lt  \ \epsilon\,
        </me>.

        <idx><h>uniform convergence</h></idx>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes we want to express that either notion of convergence
        holds only on a subset <m>H</m> of <m>G</m>, 
        in which case we say that <m>(f_n)</m> converges
        pointwise/uniformly on<nbsp/><m>H</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    It should be clear that uniform convergence on a set implies
    pointwise convergence on that set; 
    but the converse is not generally true.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's digest these two notions of convergence of a function
    sequence by describing them using quantifiers; 
    as usual, <m>\forall</m> denotes <em>for all</em>
    and <m>\exists</m> means <em>there exists</em>.
    Pointwise convergence on <m>G</m> says
    <me>
      \forall \, \epsilon > 0 \ \ \forall \, z \in G \ \ \exists \, N
      \ \ \forall \, n \geq N \ \ \left| f_n(z) - f(z) \right| \ \lt
      \ \epsilon \, 
    </me>,
    whereas uniform convergence on <m>G</m> translates into
    <me>
      \forall \, \epsilon > 0 \ \ \exists \, N \ \ \forall \, z \in G
      \ \ \forall \, n \geq N \ \ \left| f_n(z) - f(z) \right| \ \lt
      \ \epsilon \, 
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    No big deal <mdash/> we only exchanged two of the quantifiers.
    In the first case, <m>N</m> may well depend on <m>z</m>,
    in the second case we need to find an <m>N</m> that works for all
    <m>z \in G</m>. 
    And this can make all the difference <ellipsis/>
  </p>
  <example xml:id="ex_nonuniformconv">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f_n : D[0,1] \to \C</m> be defined by <m>f_n(z) = z^n</m>.
        We claim that this sequence of functions converges pointwise to
        <m>f: D[0,1] \to \C</m> given by <m>f(z) = 0</m>.
        This is immediate for the point <m>z =0</m>.
        Now given any <m>\epsilon > 0</m> and <m>0 \lt  |z| \lt  1</m>,
        choose <m>N > \frac{ \ln(\epsilon) }{ \ln|z| }</m>.
        Then for all <m>n \ge N</m>,
        <me>
          \left| f_n(z) - f(z) \right| \= \left| z^n - 0 \right| \=
          |z|^n \ \le \ |z|^N \ \lt  \ \epsilon \, 
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (You ought to check carefully that all of our inequalities work the way we claim they do.)

    </statement>
  </example>
  <example xml:id="ex_uniformconv">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f_n : D[0, \frac 1 2] \to \C</m> be defined by

        We claim that this sequence of functions converges uniformly to

    The differences between <xref ref="ex_nonuniformconv"/>
    and <xref ref="ex_uniformconv"/> are subtle,
    and we suggest you meditate over them for a while with a good cup
    of coffee. 
    You might already suspect that the function sequence in <xref
    ref="ex_nonuniformconv"/>
    does <em>not</em> converge uniformly,
    as we will see in a moment.
    <idx><h>coffee</h></idx>
  </p>
  <p>
    The first application illustrating the difference between
    pointwise and uniform convergence says, 
    in essence,
    that if we have a sequence of functions
    <m>\left( f_n \right)</m> that converges uniformly on <m>G</m>
    then for all <m>z_0 \in G</m> 
    <me>
      \lim_{n \to \infty} \ \lim_{z \to z_0} f_n(z) \= \lim_{z \to
      z_0} \ \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(z) \, 
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will need similar interchanges of limits frequently.
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="sequencecontionuos">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>G\subset\C</m> and
        <m>f_n: G \to \C</m> is continuous, for each <m>n \ge 1</m>.
        If <m>(f_n)</m> converges uniformly to
        <m>f: G \to \C</m> then <m>f</m> is continuous.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>z_0 \in G</m>;
        we will prove that <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>z_0</m>.
        By uniform convergence, given <m>\epsilon>0</m>,
        there is an <m>N</m> such that for all <m>z \in G</m> and all
        <m>n \geq N</m> 
        <me>
          \left| f_n(z) - f(z) \right| \ \lt  \ \frac \epsilon 3 \,
          </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we make use of the continuity of the <m>f_n</m>'s.
        This means that given
        (the same)
        <m>\epsilon>0</m>, there is a
        <m>\delta>0</m> such that whenever <m>|z-z_0| \lt  \delta</m>,
        <me>
          \left| f_n(z) - f_n(z_0) \right| \ \lt  \ \frac \epsilon 3 \,
          </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        All that's left is putting those two inequalities together:
        by the triangle inequality (<xref ref="cor_triangleineq"/> c)),
        <md>
          <mrow>\left| f(z) - f(z_0) \right| \ \amp = \ \left| f(z) -
          f_n(z) + f_n(z) - f_n(z_0) + f_n(z_0) - f(z_0) \right|</mrow> 
          <mrow>\amp \leq \ \left| f(z) - f_n(z) \right| + \left| f_n(z)
          - f_n(z_0) \right| + \left| f_n(z_0) - f(z_0) \right|</mrow> 
          <mrow>\amp \lt  \ \epsilon \, </mrow>
          </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proves that <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>z_0</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    <xref ref="sequencecontionuos"/>
    can sometimes give a hint that a function sequence does not
    converge uniformly. 
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We modify <xref ref="ex_nonuniformconv"/>
        and consider the real function sequence
        <m>f_n: [0,1] \to \R</m> given by <m>f_n(x) = x^n</m>.
        It converges pointwise to <m>f: [0,1] \to \R</m> given by
        <me>
          f(x) = \begin{cases}0 \amp  \text{ if }  0 \le x \lt  1 \, ,
          \\ 1 \amp  \text{ if }  x = 1 \, . \end{cases} 
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        As this limiting function is not continuous,
        the above convergence cannot be uniform.
        This gives a strong indication that the convergence in
        <xref ref="ex_nonuniformconv"/> is not uniform either,
        though this needs a separate proof,
        as the domain of the functions in
        <xref ref="ex_nonuniformconv"/>
        is the unit disk (<xref ref="fn_zn___0"/> b)).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Now that we have established <xref ref="sequencecontionuos"/>
    about continuity, 
    we can ask about integration of sequences or series of functions.
    The next theorem should come as no surprise;
    however, its consequences
    (which we will see shortly)
    are wide ranging.
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="seriesintegral">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>f_n: G \to \C</m> is continuous,
        for <m>n \ge 1</m>,
        <m>(f_n)</m> converges uniformly to <m>f: G \to \C</m>,
        and <m>\gg \subseteq G</m> is a piecewise smooth path.
        Then
        <me>
          \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_\gamma f_n \= \int_\gamma f \,
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We may assume that <m>\gg</m> is not just a point,
        in which case the proposition holds trivially.
        Given <m>\epsilon > 0</m>,
        there exists <m>N</m> such that for all <m>z \in G</m> and all
        <m>n \ge N</m>, 
        <me>
          \left| f_n(z) - f(z) \right| \ \lt  \ \frac{ \epsilon }{
          \length(\gg) } \, 
          </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        With <xref ref="intprop"/>
        <xref ref="int4"/> we can thus estimate
        <me>
          \left| \int_\gamma f_n - \int_\gamma f \right| \= \left|
          \int_\gamma f_n - f \right| \ \leq \ \max_{z \in \gamma}
          \left| f_n(z) - f(z) \right| \cdot \length (\gamma) \ \lt  \

      </p>
    </proof>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    All of these notions for sequences of functions hold verbatim for
    series of functions. 
    For example,
    if <m>\sum_{ k \ge 1 } f_k(z)</m> converges uniformly on <m>G</m> and
    <m>\gg \subseteq G</m> is a piecewise smooth path, then
    <me>
      \int_\gg \sum_{ k \ge 1 } f_k(z) \, \diff{z} \= \sum_{ k \ge 1 }
      \int_\gg f_k(z) \, \diff{z} \, 
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some sense, the above identity is <em>the</em>
    reason we care about uniform convergence.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several criteria for uniform convergence;
    see, e.g., <xref ref="sup-_0"/>
    and <xref ref="fn_zn___0"/>,
    and the following result, sometimes called the <em>Weierstra&#223;
    <m>M</m>-test</em>.
    <idx><h>Weierstra&#223;
    <m>M</m>-test</h></idx>
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="mtest">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>f_k : G \to \C</m> for <m>k \ge 1</m>,
        and <m>|f_k(z)| \le M_k</m> for all <m>z \in G</m>,
        where <m>\sum_{ k \ge 1 } M_k</m> converges.
        Then <m>\sum_{k \geq 1} \left|f_k\right|</m> and
        <m>\sum_{k \geq 1} f_k</m> converge uniformly in <m>G</m>.
        (We say the series <m>\sum_{k \geq 1} f_k</m>
        <em>converges absolutely and uniformly</em>.)
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        For each fixed <m>z</m>,
        the series <m>\sum_{k \geq 1} f_k(z)</m> converges absolutely by
        <xref ref="cor_comparisonseries"/>.
        To show that the convergence is uniform, let <m>\epsilon > 0</m>.
        Then there exists <m>N</m> such that for all <m>n \ge N</m>,
        <me>
          \sum_{k \ge 1} M_k - \sum_{k=1}^nM_k \= \sum_{k >n}M_k \ \lt
          \ \epsilon \, 
          </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus for all <m>z \in G</m> and <m>n \ge N</m>,
        <me>
          \abs{\sum_{k \geq 1} f_k(z)-\sum_{k=1}^nf_k(z)} \=
          \abs{\sum_{k >n}f_k(z)} \ \le \ \sum_{k >n}\abs{f_k(z)} \ \le
          \ \sum_{k >n}M_k \ \lt  \ \epsilon \, 
          </me>,
          which proves uniform convergence.
          Replace <m>f_k</m> with <m>\left|f_k\right|</m> in this argument
          to see that 
          <m>\sum_{k \geq 1} \left|f_k\right|</m> also converges uniformly.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </proposition>
  <example xml:id="ex_geomseriesasfunction">
    <statement>
      <p>
        We revisit <xref ref="ex_geomseries"/>
        and consider the geometric series
        <m>\sum_{ k \ge 1 } z^k</m> as a series of functions in <m>z</m>.
        We know from <xref ref="ex_geomseries"/>
        that this function series converges pointwise for <m>|z| \lt  1</m>:
        <me>
          \sum_{ k \ge 1 } z^k \= \frac z {1-z} \,
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To study uniform convergence,
        we apply <xref ref="mtest"/> with <m>f_k(z) = z^k</m>.
        We need a series of upper bounds that converges,
        so fix a real number <m>0 \lt  r \lt  1</m> and let <m>M_k = r^k</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          |f_k(z)| \= |z|^k \ \le \ r^k \qquad \text{ for }  \ |z| \le
          r \, 
        </me>,
        and <m>\sum_{ k \ge 1 } r^k</m> converges by
        <xref ref="ex_geomseries"/>.
        Thus, <xref ref="mtest"/>
        says that <m>\sum_{ k \ge 1 } z^k</m> converges uniformly for
        <m>|z| \le r</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We note the subtle distinction of domains for
        pointwise/uniform convergence: 
        <m>\sum_{ k \ge 1 } z^k</m> converges (absolutely) for <m>|z|\lt 1</m>,
        but to force <em>uniform</em> convergence,
        we need to shrink the domain to <m>|z| \le r</m> for some
        (arbitrary but fixed)
        <m>r\lt 1</m>.
