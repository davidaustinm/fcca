  <title>Cauchy's Theorem</title>
  <p>
    <em>The</em> central theorem of complex analysis is based on the
    following concept.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>\gg_0</m> and <m>\gg_1</m> are closed paths in the
        region <m>G \subseteq \C</m>, 
        parametrized by <m>\gg_0(t), \ 0 \leq t \leq 1</m>,
        and <m>\gg_1(t), \ 0 \leq t \leq 1</m>, respectively.
        Then <m>\gg_0</m> is <em><m>G</m>-homotopic</em>
        to <m>\gg_1</m> if there exists a continuous function <m>h :
        [0,1]^2 \to G</m> such that, 
        for all <m>s,\,t\in[0,1]</m>,
        <md>
          <mrow>h(t,0) \amp = \gg_0(t) \, , </mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="eq_homotopydef" number="yes">h(t,1) \amp =
          \gg_1(t) \, ,</mrow> 
          <mrow>h(0,s) \amp = h(1,s) \,</mrow>
        </md>.
        <idx><h>homotopic</h></idx>
        We use the notation <m>\gg_1\sim_G\gg_2</m> to mean
        <m>\gg_1</m> is <m>G</m>-homotopic to <m>\gg_2</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The function <m>h(t,s)</m> is called a <em>homotopy</em>.
    <idx><h>homotopy</h></idx>
    For each fixed <m>s</m>,
    a homotopy <m>h(t,s)</m> is a path parametrized by <m>t</m>,
    and as <m>s</m> goes from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m>,
    these paths continuously transform from <m>\gg_0</m> to <m>\gg_1</m>.
    The last condition in <xref ref="eq_homotopydef"/> simply says
    that each of these paths is also closed. 
  </p>
  <example xml:id="exam_homotopy">
    <statement>
      <p>
        <xref ref="homotopicfig">Figure</xref>
        attempts to illustrate that the unit circle is
        <m>(\C \setminus \{ 0 \})</m>-homotopic to the square with vertices <m>\pm 3 \pm 3i</m>.
        Indeed, you should check
        (<xref ref="ex_checkhomotopyexample"/>)
        that
        <men xml:id="eq_checkhomotopyexample">
          h(t,s) \ := \ (1-s) e^{ 2 \pi i t } + 3s \times
          \begin{cases} 1 + 8it \amp  \text{ if }  0 \le t \le \frac 1
          8 \, , \\ 2-8t + i \amp  \text{ if }  \frac 1 8 \le t \le
          \frac 3 8 \, , \\ -1 + 4i(1-2t) \amp  \text{ if }  \frac 3 8
          \le t \le \frac 5 8 \, , \\ 8t-6 - i \amp  \text{ if }
          \frac 5 8 \le t \le \frac 7 8 \, , \\ 1 + 8i(t-1) \amp
          \text{ if }  \frac 7 8 \le t \le 1 \end{cases} 
        </men>
        gives a homotopy.
        Note that <m>h(t,s) \ne 0</m> for any <m>0 \le t, s \le 1</m> (hence
        <q><m>(\C \setminus \{ 0 \})</m>-homotopic</q>).
      <xref ref="homotopicfig"/> shows the paths <m>h(t,s)</m> for
      <m>s=0,0.25, 0.5,0.75</m> and <m>1</m>.

    shows that <m>\sim_G</m> is an equivalence relation on the set of
    closed paths in <m>G</m>. 
    The definition of homotopy applies to
    <em>parametrizations</em> of curves;
    but <xref ref="ex_homotopyReparametrization"/>,
    together with transitivity of <m>\sim_G</m>,
    shows that homotopy is invariant under reparametrizations.

  <p>
    As a historical aside,
    it is assumed that Johann Carl Friedrich Gau&#223;
    (1777<ndash/>1855) knew a version of this theorem in 1811 but
    published it only in 1831. 
    Cauchy (of Cauchy<ndash/>Riemann equations fame) published his
    version in 1825, Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstra&#223;
    (1815<ndash/>1897) his in 1842. 
    <xref ref="cauchythm">Theorem</xref>
    is often called the <em>Cauchy<ndash/>Goursat Theorem</em>,
    since Cauchy assumed that the derivative of <m>f</m> was
    continuous, 
    a condition that was first removed by Edouard Jean-Baptiste
    Goursat (1858<ndash/>1936). 
    <idx><h>Cauchy<ndash/>Goursat theorem</h></idx>
  </p>
  <p>
    Before discussing a proof of <xref ref="cauchythm">Theorem</xref>,
    we give a basic, yet prototypical application of it:
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We claim that
        <men xml:id="eq_cauchyexample">
          \int_\gg \frac {\diff{z}} z \ = \ 2 \pi i
        </men>
        where <m>\gg</m> is the square in <xref
        ref="homotopicfig">Figure</xref>, 
        oriented counter-clockwise.
        We could, of course, compute this integral by hand,
        but it is easier to apply Cauchy's <xref
        ref="cauchythm"/>
        to the function <m>f(z) = \frac 1 z</m>,
        which is holomorphic in <m>G = \C \setminus \{ 0 \}</m>.
        We showed in<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_checkhomotopyexample"/> that
        <m>\gg</m> is <m>G</m>-homotopic to the unit circle. 
        <xref ref="ex_circleint"/>
        says that integrating <m>f</m> over the unit circle gives <m>2
        \pi i</m> and so Cauchy's <xref ref="cauchythm"/>
        implies<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_cauchyexample"/>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <proof>
    <p>
      The full proof of Cauchy's Theorem is beyond the scope of this book.
      However, there are several easier proofs under more restrictive
      hypotheses than <xref ref="cauchythm"/>.
      We shall present a proof under the following extra assumptions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative <m>f'</m> is continuous in <m>G</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The homotopy <m>h</m> from <m>\gg_0</m> to <m>\gg_1</m>
            has piecewise, 
            continuous second derivatives.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Technically, this is the assumption on <m>h</m>:
      <me>
        h(t,s) = \begin{cases}h_1(t,s) \amp  \text{ if }  0 \le t \le
        t_1 \, , \\ h_2(t,s) \amp  \text{ if }  t_1 \le t \le t_2 \, ,
        \\ \vdots \\ h_n(t,s) \amp  \text{ if }  t_{ n-1 } \le t \le 1
        \, , \end{cases} 
      </me>
      where each <m>h_j(t,s)</m> has continuous second partials.<fn>
      As we have seen with other
      <q>piecewise</q>
      definitions,
      the behavior of <m>h</m> at the subdivision lines <m>t=t_i</m>
      needs to be understood in terms of limits. 
      </fn>
      (<xref ref="exam_homotopy"/> gives one instance.)
      Now we turn to the proof under these extra assumptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For <m>0 \leq s \leq 1</m>,
      let <m>\gg_s</m> be the path parametrized by <m>h(t,s), \ 0 \leq
      t \leq 1</m>. 
      Consider the function <m>I: [0,1] \to \C</m> given by
      <me>
        I(s) \ := \ \int_{ \gg_s } f \,
      </me>,
      so that <m>I(0) = \int_{\gg_0} f</m> and <m>I(1) = \int_{\gg_1} f</m>.
      We will show that <m>I</m> is constant;
      in particular, <m>I(0) = I(1)</m>, which proves the theorem.
      By Leibniz's rule
      <idx><h>Leibniz's rule</h></idx>
      (<xref ref="leibnizrule">Theorem</xref>),

        } \, \diff{t} \  = \ \int_0^1 \frac{\partial}{\partial s}

        \frac{\partial h}{\partial s} \right) \diff{t} \, </mrow> 
      </md>.
      Note that we used <xref
      ref="thm_mixedpartialscommute">Theorem</xref> 
      to switch the order of the second partials in the penultimate
      step<mdash/>here is where we need our assumption that <m>h</m>
      has continuous second partials. 
      Also, we needed continuity of <m>f'</m> in order to apply
      Leibniz's rule. 
      If <m>h</m> is piecewise defined,
      we split up the integral accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
      (<xref ref="fundthmcalc">Theorem</xref>),
      applied separately to the real and imaginary parts of the above
      integrand, 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \frac{d}{\diff{s}} I(s) \amp \ = \ \int_0^1
          \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( f \left( h(t,s) \right)
          \frac{\partial h}{\partial s} \right) \diff{t}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \ = \ f(h(1,s))
          \, \frac{\partial h}{\partial s} (1,s) - f(h(0,s)) \,
          \frac{\partial h}{\partial s} (0,s)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp \ = \ 0 \,
        </mrow>
      </md>,
      where the last step follows from
      <m>h(0,s) = h(1,s)</m> for all<nbsp/><m>s</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

        Let <m>G \subseteq \C</m> be a region.
        If the closed path <m>\gg</m> is <m>G</m>-homotopic to a point 
        (that is, a constant path)
        then <m>\gg</m> is <em><m>G</m>-contractible</em>,
        and we write <m>\gg\sim_G0</m>.

    The fact that an integral over a point is zero has the following
    immediate consequence. 
  </p>
  <corollary xml:id="cauchycor">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>G \subseteq \C</m> is a region,
        <m>f</m> is holomorphic in <m>G</m>,
        <m>\gg</m> is piecewise smooth, and <m>\gg \sim_G 0</m>.
        Then

      </p>
    </statement>
  </corollary>
  <p>
    This corollary is worth meditating over.
    For example,
    you should compare it with <xref ref="antidercor"/>:
    both results give a zero integral,
    yet they make truly opposite assumptions
    (one about the existence of an antiderivative,
    the other about the existence of a derivative).
  </p>
  <p>
    Naturally, <xref ref="cauchycor"/>
    gives many evaluations of integrals, such as this:
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Since <m>\Log</m> is holomorphic in
        <m>G = \C \setminus \R_{ \le 0 }</m> and the ellipse
        <m>\gg</m> in <xref ref="contractiblefig"/> is
        <m>G</m>-contractible, 
        <xref ref="cauchycor"/>
        gives
        <me>
          \int_\gg \Log(z) \, \diff{z} \ = \ 0 \,
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    <xref ref="C-contractible"/>(a) says that any closed path is
    <m>\C</m>-contractible, 
    which yields the following special case of
    <xref ref="cauchycor"/>.
  </p>
  <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f</m> is entire and <m>\gg</m> is any piecewise smooth

  <p>
    The theorems and corollaries in this section are useful not just
    for showing that certain integrals are zero:

        (Try computing it from first principles.)
        We use a partial fractions expansion to write

        The first integral on the right-hand side is zero by <xref
