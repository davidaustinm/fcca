  <title>Differentiation</title>
  <introduction>
    <blockquote>
      <em>Mathematical study and research are very suggestive of
      mountaineering. Whymper made several efforts before he climbed
      the Matterhorn in the 1860's and even then it cost the life of
      four of his party. Now, however, any tourist can be hauled up
      for a small cost, and perhaps does not appreciate the difficulty
      of the original ascent. So in mathematics, it may be found hard
      to realise the great initial difficulty of making a little step
      which now seems so natural and \ix{obvious}, and it may not be
      surprising if such a step has been found and lost again.</em>
      Louis Joel Mordell (1888<ndash/>1972)

      We will now start our study of complex functions.
      <em>The</em> fundamental concept on which all of calculus is based is that of a limit<mdash/>it allows us to develop the central properties of continuity and differentiability of functions.
      Our goal in this chapter is to do the same for complex functions.
