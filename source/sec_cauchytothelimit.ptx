  <title>Taking Cauchy's Formulas to the Limit</title>
  <p>
    Many beautiful applications of Cauchy's Integral Formulas
    (such as <xref ref="cauchyformula">Theorems</xref>
    and <xref ref="cauchyformula2"></xref>)
    arise from considerations of the limiting behavior of the integral as the path gets arbitrarily large.
    The first and most famous application concerns the roots of polynomials.
    As a preparation we prove the following inequality,
    which is generally quite useful.
    It says that for <m>|z|</m> large enough,
    a polynomial <m>p(z)</m> of degree <m>d</m> looks almost like a constant times<nbsp/><m>z^d</m>.
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="polynomialestimate">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>p(z)</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>d</m> with leading coefficient <m>a_d</m>.
        Then there is a real number <m>R</m> such that
        <me>
          \tfrac12\abs{a_d}\abs{z}^d \ \le \ \abs{p(z)} \ \le \ 2\abs{a_d}\abs{z}^d
        </me>
        for all <m>z</m> satisfying <m>\abs{z}\ge R</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Since <m>p(z)</m> has degree <m>d</m>,
      its leading coefficient <m>a_d</m> is not zero,
      and we can factor out <m>a_d \, z^d</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>\abs{p(z)} \amp \= \abs{a_dz^d + a_{d-1}z^{d-1} + a_{d-2}z^{d-2} + \dots + a_1z+a_0}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \= \abs{a_d}\abs{z}^d\abs{1+\frac{a_{d-1}}{a_dz}+\frac{a_{d-2}}{a_dz^2}+\dots+ \frac{a_1}{a_dz^{d-1}}+\frac{a_0}{a_dz^d}} </mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the sum inside the last factor has limit <m>1</m> as <m>z\to\infty</m>
      (by <xref ref="ex_polynomiallimitaszgrows">Exercise</xref>),
      and so its modulus is between
      <m>\frac 1 2</m> and <m>2</m> as long as <m>|z|</m> is large enough.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <theorem xml:id="fundthmalg">
    <title>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra<footnote>
    The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra was first proved by Gau&#223;<nbsp/>(in his doctoral dissertation in 1799, which had a flaw<mdash/>later, he provided three rigorous proofs), although its statement had been assumed to be correct long before Gau&#223;'s time.
    It is amusing that such an important algebraic result can be proved purely analytically.  There are proofs of the Fundamental Theorem
    of Algebra that do not use complex analysis.  On the other hand, all proofs use <em>some</em> analysis (such as the Intermediate Value
    Theorem).  The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra refers to <em>algebra</em> in the sense that it existed in 1799, not to modern algebra.
    Thus one might say that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is neither fundamental to algebra nor even a theorem of algebra.
    The proof we give here is due to Anton R.<nbsp/>Schep and appeared in the <em>American Mathematical Monthly</em>
    (January 2009).

    <p>
      Suppose (by way of contradiction) that <m>p</m> does not have any roots,
      that is, <m>p(z) \not= 0</m> for all <m>z \in \C</m>.
      Then <m>\frac 1 {p(z)}</m> is entire,
      and so Cauchy's Integral Formula
      (<xref ref="cauchyformulacircle">Theorem</xref>)
      gives
      <me>
        \frac1{p(0)} \= \frac1{2\pi i}\int_{C[0,R]}\frac{\frac 1 {p(z)}}{z}\,\diff{z} \,
      </me>,
      for any <m>R>0</m>.
      Let <m>d</m> be the degree of <m>p(z)</m> and <m>a_d</m> its leading coefficient.
      <xref ref="intprop">Propositions</xref> <xref ref="int4"></xref>
      and <xref ref="polynomialestimate"></xref> allow us to estimate,
      for sufficiently large <m>R</m>,
      <me>
        \left| \frac 1 {p(0)} \right| \= \frac 1 {2 \pi} \left| \int_{C[0,R]} \frac{ \diff{z} }{ z \, p(z) } \right| \ \le \ \frac 1 {2 \pi}  \max_{ z \in C[0,R] } \left| \frac{ 1 }{ z \, p(z) } \right| 2 \pi R \ \le \ \frac{ 2 }{ |a_d| R^d } \,
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The left-hand side is independent of <m>R</m>,
      while the right-hand side can be made arbitrarily small
      (by choosing <m>R</m> sufficiently large),
      and so we conclude that <m>\frac 1 {p(0)} = 0</m>, which is impossible.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    <xref ref="fundthmalg">Theorem</xref>
    implies that any polynomial <m>p</m> can be factored into linear terms of the form <m>z-a</m> where <m>a</m> is a root of <m>p</m>,
    as we can apply the corollary,
    after getting a root <m>a</m>,
    to <m>\frac{ p(z) }{z-a}</m>
    (which is again a polynomial by the division algorithm),
    etc.<nbsp/>(see also <xref ref="fta">Exercise</xref>).
  </p>
  <p>
    A compact reformulation of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
    (<xref ref="fundthmalg">Theorem</xref>)
    is to say that <m>\C</m> is <em>algebraically closed
        <idx><h>algebraically closed</h></idx>
    </em>.
    In contrast, <m>\R</m> is not algebraically closed.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The polynomial <m>p(x) = 2x^4+5x^2+3</m> has no roots in <m>\R</m>.
        The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
        (<xref ref="fundthmalg">Theorem</xref>)
        states that <m>p</m> must have a root
        (in fact, four roots)
        in<nbsp/><m>\C</m>:
        <me>
          p(x) \= \left( x^2+1 \right) \left( 2x^2+3 \right) \= \left( x+i \right) \left( x-i \right) \left( \sqrt{2} \, x + \sqrt{3} \, i \right) \left( \sqrt{2} \, x - \sqrt{3} \, i \right)

    <title>Liouville's<footnote>This
    theorem is for historical reasons erroneously attributed to Joseph Liouville (1809<ndash/>1882). It was published earlier

      Suppose <m>|f(z)| \leq M</m> for all <m>z \in \C</m>.
      Given any <m>w \in \C</m>,
      we apply <xref ref="cauchyformula2">Theorem</xref>
      with the circle <m>C[w,R]</m>;
      note that we can choose any <m>R>0</m> because <m>f</m> is entire.

      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right-hand side can be made arbitrarily small,
      as we are allowed to choose <m>R</m> as large as we want.
      This implies that <m>f'=0</m>, and hence,
      by <xref ref="derivative0">Theorem</xref>, <m>f</m> is constant.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    As an example of the usefulness of Liouville's theorem
    (<xref ref="liouville">Corollary</xref>),
    we give another proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,
    close to Gau&#223;'s original proof.
  </p>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose (by way of contradiction) that <m>p</m> does not have any roots,
      that is, <m>p(z) \not= 0</m> for all <m>z \in \C</m>.
      Thus the function <m>f(z) = \frac 1 {p(z)}</m> is entire.
      But <m>f \to 0</m> as <m>|z| \to \infty</m>,
      by <xref ref="polynomialestimate">Proposition</xref>;
      consequently,
      by <xref ref="bounded">Exercise</xref>, <m>f</m> is bounded.
      Now we apply <xref ref="liouville">Corollary</xref>
      to deduce that <m>f</m> is constant.
      Hence <m>p</m> is constant, which contradicts our assumptions.

        This exercise outlines how to extend some of the results of this chapter to the Riemann sphere as defined in <xref ref="sec_riemannspere">Section</xref>.
        Suppose <m>G \subseteq \C</m> is a region that contains 0, let <m>f</m> be a continuous function on <m>G</m>,
        and let <m>\gg \subset G \setminus \{0\}</m> be a piecewise smooth path in <m>G</m> avoiding the origin,
        parametrized as <m>\gg(t)</m>, <m>a \le t \le b</m>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Show that
              <me>
                \int_\gg f(z) \,\diff{z} \= \int_\sigma f\!\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \frac{1}{z^2} \, \diff{z}
              </me>
              where <m>\sigma(t) := \frac{ 1 }{ \gg(t) }</m>, <m>a \le t \le b</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now suppose <m>\lim_{ z \to 0 } f\!\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \frac{1}{z^2} = L</m> is finite.
        Let <m>H := \left\{ \frac 1 z : \, z \in G \setminus \{ 0 \} \right\}</m> and define the function <m>g: H \cup \{ 0 \} \to \C</m> by
        <me>
          g(z) \ := \ \begin{cases}f\!\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \frac{1}{z^2} \amp  \text{ if }  z \in H, \\ L                                       \amp  \text{ if }  z=0. \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus <m>g</m> is continuous on
        <m>H \cup \{ 0 \}</m> and (a) gives the identity
        <me>
          \int_\gg f \= \int_\sigma g \,
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular,
        we can transfer certain properties between these two integrals.
        For example, if <m>\int_\sigma g</m> is path independent,
        so is <m>\int_\gg f</m>.
        Here is but one application:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Show that <m>\int_\gg z^n \, \diff{z}</m> is path independent for any integer <m>n \ne -1</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Conclude (once more) that <m>\int_\gg z^n \, \diff{z} = 0</m> for any integer <m>n \ne -1</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
