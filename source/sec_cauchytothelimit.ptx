  <title>Taking Cauchy's Formulas to the Limit</title>
  <p>
    Several beautiful applications of Cauchy's Integral Formulas
    (such as <xref ref="cauchyformula"/>
    and <xref ref="cauchyformula2"/>)
    arise from considerations of the limiting behavior of the integral
    as the path gets arbitrarily large. 
    The first and most famous application concerns the roots of polynomials.
    As a preparation we prove the following inequality,
    which is generally quite useful.
    It says that for <m>|z|</m> large enough,
    a polynomial <m>p(z)</m> of degree <m>d</m> looks almost like a
    constant times <m>z^d</m>. 
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="polynomialestimate">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>p(z)</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>d</m> with
        leading coefficient <m>a_d</m>. 
        Then there is a real number <m>R</m> such that
        <me>
          \tfrac12\abs{a_d}\abs{z}^d \ \le \ \abs{p(z)} \ \le \
          2\abs{a_d}\abs{z}^d 
        </me>
        for all <m>z</m> satisfying <m>\abs{z}\ge R</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>p(z)</m> has degree <m>d</m>,
        its leading coefficient <m>a_d</m> is not zero,
        and we can factor out <m>a_d \, z^d</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \abs{p(z)} \amp \ = \ \abs{a_dz^d + a_{d-1}z^{d-1} +
            a_{d-2}z^{d-2} + \dots + a_1z+a_0}
          </mrow> 
          <mrow>
            \amp \ = \
            \abs{a_d}\abs{z}^d\abs{1+\frac{a_{d-1}}{a_dz}+
            \frac{a_{d-2}}{a_dz^2}+\dots+
            \frac{a_1}{a_dz^{d-1}}+\frac{a_0}{a_dz^d}}
          </mrow> 
          </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the sum inside the last factor has limit <m>1</m> as <m>z\to\infty</m> 
        (by <xref ref="ex_polynomiallimitaszgrows">Exercise</xref>),
        and so its modulus is between
        <m>\frac 1 2</m> and <m>2</m> as long as <m>|z|</m> is large enough.

  <theorem xml:id="fundthmalg">
    <title>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra<fn>
      The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra was first proved by
      Gau&#223; (in his doctoral dissertation in 1799, which had a
      flaw<mdash/>later, he provided three rigorous proofs), although
      its statement had been assumed to be correct long before
      Gau&#223;'s time. 
      It is amusing that such an important algebraic result can be
      proved purely analytically.  There are proofs of the Fundamental
      Theorem 
      of Algebra that do not use complex analysis.  On the other hand,
      all proofs use <em>some</em> analysis (such as the Intermediate
      Value 
      Theorem).  The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra refers to
      <em>algebra</em> in the sense that it existed in 1799, not to
      modern algebra. 
      Thus one might say that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is
      neither fundamental to algebra nor even a theorem of algebra. 
      The proof we give here is due to Anton R.<nbsp/>Schep and appeared
      in the <em>American Mathematical Monthly</em> 
      (January 2009).

        Suppose (by way of contradiction) that <m>p</m> does not have

        Then <m>\frac 1 {p(z)}</m> is entire,
        and so Cauchy's Integral Formula

        gives

        for any <m>R>0</m>.
        Let <m>d</m> be the degree of <m>p(z)</m> and <m>a_d</m> its
        leading coefficient. 
        <xref ref="intprop"/>(<xref text="local" ref="int4"/>)

          \left| \frac 1 {p(0)} \right| \ = \ \frac 1 {2 \pi} \left|

        The left-hand side is independent of <m>R</m>,
        while the right-hand side can be made arbitrarily small
        (by choosing <m>R</m> sufficiently large),

        The right-hand side can be made arbitrarily small,

    As an example of the usefulness of Liouville's theorem
    (<xref ref="liouville">Corollary</xref>),
    we give another proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,
    close to Gau&#223;'s original proof.

  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose (by way of contradiction) that <m>p</m> does not have any roots,
      that is, <m>p(z) \not= 0</m> for all <m>z \in \C</m>.
      Thus the function <m>f(z) = \frac 1 {p(z)}</m> is entire.
      But <m>f \to 0</m> as <m>|z| \to \infty</m>,
      by <xref ref="polynomialestimate"/>;
      consequently,
      by <xref ref="bounded"/>, <m>f</m> is bounded.
      Now we apply <xref ref="liouville">Corollary</xref>
      to deduce that <m>f</m> is constant.
      Hence <m>p</m> is constant, which contradicts our assumptions.
