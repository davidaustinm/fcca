    The central result about integration of a real function is the
    Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 
    (<xref ref="fundthmcalc">Theorem</xref>),
    and our next goal is to discuss complex versions of this theorem.
    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus makes a number of important claims:
    that continuous functions are integrable,
    their antiderivatives are continuous and differentiable,
    and that antiderivatives provide easy ways to compute values of
    definite integrals. 
    The difference between the real case and the complex case is that
    in the latter, 
    we need to think about integrals over arbitrary paths
    in<nbsp/><m>\C</m>.

        If <m>F</m> is holomorphic in the region <m>G \subseteq \C</m> and
        <m>F'(z) = f(z)</m> for all <m>z \in G</m>,
        then <m>F</m> is <em>an antiderivative
        of <m>f</m> on <m>G</m></em>,
        also known as a <em>primitive
        of <m>f</m> on<nbsp/><m>G</m>.</em>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We have already seen that <m>F(z) = z^2</m> is entire and has
        derivative <m>f(z) = 2z</m>. 
        Thus, <m>F</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f</m> on any region
        <m>G \subseteq \C</m>. 
        The same goes for <m>F(z) = z^2 + c</m>,
        where <m>c \in \C</m> is any constant. 
      </p>
    </statement>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Since
        <me>
          \frac{ d }{ \diff{z} } \left( \frac 1 {2i} (\exp(iz) -
          \exp(-iz)) \right) \= \frac 1 2 (\exp(iz) + \exp(-iz)) \, 
        </me>,
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>F(z) = \sin z</m> is an antiderivative of
        <m>f(z) = \cos z</m> on<nbsp/><m>\C</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The function <m>F(z) = \Log(z)</m> is an antiderivative of
        <m>f(z) = \frac 1 z</m> on <m>\C \setminus \R_{ \le 0 }</m>.
        Note that <m>f</m> is holomorphic in the larger region <m>\C
        \setminus \{ 0 \}</m>; 
        however, we will see in <xref ref="ex_antiderivnotexist"/>
        that <m>f</m> <em>cannot</em> 
        have an antiderivative on that region.

    Here is the complex analogue of <xref ref="fundthmcalc">Theorem</xref>

  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="antiderthm">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>G \subseteq \C</m> is a region and
        <m>\gg \subset G</m> is a piecewise smooth path with
        parametrization <m>\gg(t)</m>, 
        <m>a \leq t \leq b</m>.
        If <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>G</m> and <m>F</m> is any

  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      This follows immediately from the definition of a complex
      integral and <xref ref="fundthmcalc">Theorem</xref> 
      <xref ref="fundthmcalc2"></xref>,
      since <m>\frac{ d }{ \diff{t} } F(\gg(t)) = f(\gg(t)) \,

      <me>
        \int_\gg f \= \int_a^b f(\gg(t)) \, \gg'(t) \, \diff{t} \= F

    <statement>
      <p>
        Since <m>F(z) = \frac 1 2 \, z^2</m> is an antiderivative of

        <me>
          \int_\gg f \= \frac 1 2 (1+i)^2 - \frac 1 2 \, 0^2 \= i

  <p>
    There are several interesting consequences of <xref ref="antiderthm"/>.
    For starters, if <m>\gg</m> is closed (that is,
    <m>\gg(a)=\gg(b)</m>) we effortlessly obtain the following.
  </p>
  <corollary xml:id="antidercor">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>G \subseteq \C</m> is open,
        <m>\gg \subset G</m> is a piecewise smooth closed path,
        and <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>G</m> and has an
        antiderivative on <m>G</m>. 
        Then
        <me>
          \int_\gg f \= 0 \,
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </corollary>
  <p>
    This corollary is immediately useful as a test for existence of
    antiderivatives: 
  </p>
  <example xml:id="ex_antiderivnotexist">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The function <m>f: \C \setminus \{0\} \to \C</m> given by
        <m>f(z) = \frac 1 z</m> satisfies 
        <m>\int_{\gg} f = 2\pi i</m> for the unit circle <m>\gg
        \subset \C \setminus \{0\}</m>, 
        by <xref ref="ex_circleint"/>.
        Since this integral is nonzero,
        <m>f</m> cannot have an antiderivative in <m>\C \setminus
        \{0\}</m>.

    We now turn to the complex analogue of <xref
    ref="fundthmcalc">Theorem</xref> 
    <xref ref="fundthmcalc1"></xref>.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_FTC1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>G \subseteq \C</m> is a region and <m>z_0 \in G</m>.
        Let <m>f: G \to \C</m> be a continuous function such that
        <m>\int_\gg f = 0</m> for any closed piecewise smooth path
        <m>\gg \subset G</m>. 
        Then the function <m>F: G \to \C</m> defined by
        <me>
          F(z) \ := \ \int_{\gg_z} f
        </me>,
        where <m>\gg_z</m> is any piecewise smooth path in <m>G</m>
        from <m>z_0</m> to <m>z</m>, 
        is an antiderivative for <m>f</m> on <m>G</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        There are two statements that we have to prove:
        first, that our definition of <m>F</m> is sound<mdash/>that is,
        the integral defining <m>F</m> does not depend on <em>which</em>
        path we take from <m>z_0</m> to <m>z</m><mdash/>and second,
        that <m>F'(z) = f(z)</m> for all <m>z \in G</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>G \subseteq \C</m> is a region, <m>z_0 \in G</m>,
        and <m>f: G \to \C</m> is a continuous function such that
        <m>\int_\gg f = 0</m> for any closed piecewise smooth path
        <m>\gg \subset G</m>. 
        Then <m>\int_\sigma f</m> evaluates to the same number for any
        piecewise smooth path 
        <m>\sigma \subset G</m> from <m>z_0</m> to <m>z \in G</m>,
        because any two such paths <m>\sigma_1</m> and
        <m>\sigma_2</m> can be concatenated to a closed path first
        tracing through 
        <m>\sigma_1</m> and then through <m>\sigma_2</m> backwards,
        which by assumption yields a zero integral:
        <me>
          \int_{ \sigma_1 } f \ - \ \int_{ \sigma_2 } f \= \int_{
          \sigma_1 - \sigma_2 } f \= 0 \, 
          </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that
        <me>
          F(z) \ := \ \int_{\gg_z} f
        </me>
        is well defined.
        By the same argument,
        <me>
          F(z+h) - F(z) \= \int_{\gg_{z+h}} f \ - \ \int_{\gg_z} f \= \int_\gg f
        </me>
        for any path <m>\gg \subset G</m> from <m>z</m> to <m>z+h</m>.
        The constant function <m>1</m> has the antiderivative <m>z</m> on <m>\C</m>,
        and so <m>\int_\gg 1 = h</m>,
        by <xref ref="antiderthm">Theorem</xref>.
        Thus
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \frac{ F(z+h) - F(z) }{ h } - f(z) \amp \= \frac 1 h
            \int_\gg f(w) \, \diff{w} \ - \ \frac{ f(z) }{ h } \int_\gg
            \diff{w}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \amp \= \frac 1 h \int_\gg (f(w)-f(z)) \, \diff{w}
          </mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>|h|</m> is sufficiently small then the line segment
        <m>\lambda</m> from <m>z</m> to <m>z+h</m> will be contained
        in <m>G</m>, and so, 
        by applying the assumptions of our theorem for the third time,
        <mdn>
          <mrow>
            \frac{ F(z+h) - F(z) }{ h } - f(z) \amp \= \frac 1 h
            \int_\gg (f(w)-f(z)) \, \diff{w}
          </mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="eq_makepathstraight">
            \amp \= \frac 1 h \int_\lambda

          </mrow>
        </mdn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will show that the right-hand side goes to zero as <m>h \to
        0</m>, 
        which will conclude the theorem.
        Given <m>\epsilon > 0</m>, we can choose <m>\delta > 0</m>
        such that 
        <me>
          \abs{ w-z } \lt  \delta \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad \abs{
          f(w) - f(z) } \lt  \epsilon 
        </me>
        because <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>z</m>.
        (We also choose <m>\delta</m> small enough so that <xref
        ref="eq_makepathstraight"/> holds.) 
        Thus if <m>|h| \lt  \delta</m>,
        we can estimate with <xref ref="intprop">Proposition</xref>
        <xref ref="int4"/>
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \abs{ \frac 1 h \int_\lambda (f(w)-f(z)) \, \diff{w} }
            \amp \ \le
            \ \frac 1 {|h|} \max_{ w \in \lambda } \abs{ f(w) - f(z) }
            \length(\lambda)

          <mrow>
            \amp \= \max_{ w \in \lambda } |f(w) - f(z)|

      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    There are several variations of <xref ref="thm_FTC1">Theorem</xref>,
    as we can play with the assumptions about paths in the statement
    of the theorem. 
    We give one such variation, namely,
    for <em>polygonal paths</em>,
    i.e., paths that are composed as unions of line segments.
    You should convince yourself that the proof of the following
    result is identical to that of <xref
    ref="thm_FTC1">Theorem</xref>.

  </corollary>
  <p>
    If you compare our proof of <xref ref="thm_FTC1">Theorem</xref> to
    its analogue in <m>\R</m>, 
    you will see similarities,
    as well as some complications due to the fact that we now have to
    operate in the plane as opposed to the real line. 
    Still, so far we have essentially been
    <q>doing calculus</q>
    when computing integrals.
    We will now take a radical departure from this philosophy by
    studying complex integrals that stay invariant under certain
    transformations of the paths we are integrating over.
