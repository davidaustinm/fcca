      We are now ready to start integrating complex
      functions<mdash/>and we will not stop doing so for the remainder of
      this book: 
      it turns out that complex integration is much richer than real integration
      (in one variable).
      The initial reason for this is that we have an extra dimension
      to play with: 
      the calculus integral <m>\int_a^b f(x) \, \diff{x}</m> has a
      fixed integration path, 
      from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> along the real line.
      For complex functions,
      there are many different ways to go from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>...
