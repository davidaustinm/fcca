      We are now ready to start integrating complex functions<mdash/>and we will not stop doing so for the remainder of this book:
      it turns out that complex integration is much richer than real integration
      (in one variable).
      The initial reason for this is that we have an extra dimension to play with:
      the calculus integral <m>\int_a^b f(x) \, \diff{x}</m> has a fixed integration path,
      from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> along the real line.
      For complex functions,
      there are many different ways to go from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>...
