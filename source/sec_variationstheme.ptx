  <idx><h>Cauchy's integral formula</h><h>extensions of</h></idx>
  <p>
    We now derive formulas for <m>f'</m> and <m>f''</m> which resemble
    Cauchy's Integral Formula 
    (<xref ref="cauchyformula"/>).
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="cauchyformula2">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>f</m> is holomorphic in the region <m>G</m> and
        <m>\gg</m> is a positively oriented, simple, 
        closed, piecewise smooth, <m>G</m>-contractible path.
        If <m>w</m> is inside <m>\gg</m> then
        <me>
          f'(w) \ = \ \frac 1 {2 \pi i} \int_\gg \frac{ f(z) }{ (z-w)^2 }
          \, \diff{z}\, 
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, <m>f''(w)</m> exists, and
        <me>
          f''(w) \ = \ \frac 1 {\pi i} \int_\gg \frac{ f(z) }{ (z-w)^3 }
          \ \diff{z} \, 
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      The idea of our proof is very similar to that of Cauchy's
      Integral Formula 
      (<xref ref="cauchyformulacircle"/>
      and <xref ref="cauchyformula"/>).
      We will study the following difference quotient,
      which we rewrite using <xref ref="cauchyformula"/>.
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp\frac{ f(w+\D w) - f(w) }{ \D w }
        </mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \ = \ \frac{1}{\D w}
        \left( \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_\gg \frac{f(z)}{z - (w+\D w)} \,
        \diff{z} - \frac 1 {2 \pi i} \int_\gg \frac{ f(z) }{ z-w } \,
        \diff{z} \right)</mrow> 
        <mrow>\amp \ = \ \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_\gg \frac{f(z)}{(z-w-\D
        w) (z-w)} \, \diff{z} \, </mrow> 
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="cauchyformula2">Theorem</xref>
      will follow if we can show that the following expression gets
      arbitrarily small as <m>\D w \to 0</m>: 
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp \frac{ f(w+\D w) - f(w) }{ \D w } - \frac 1 {2 \pi i}
        \int_\gg \frac{ f(z) }{ (z-w)^2 } \, \diff{z}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \ = \ \frac 1
        {2 \pi i} \int_\gg \left( \frac{ f(z) }{ (z-w-\D w) (z-w) } -
        \frac{ f(z) }{ (z-w)^2 } \right) \diff{z} \nonumber</mrow> 
        <mrow xml:id="eq_needstostaybounded" number="yes">\amp \ = \
        \frac{ \D w }{2 \pi i} \int_\gg \frac{ f(z) }{ (z-w-\D w)
        (z-w)^2 } \, \diff{z} \, </mrow> 
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be made arbitrarily small if we can show that the
      integral on the right-hand side stays bounded as <m>\D w \to
      0</m>. 
      In fact, by <xref ref="intprop">Proposition</xref>(<xref text="local" ref="int4"></xref>), 
      it suffices to show that the <em>integrand</em>
      stays bounded as <m>\D w \to 0</m> (because <m>\gg</m> and hence
      <m>\length (\gg)</m> are fixed). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>M := \max_{ z \in \gg } \left| f(z) \right|</m>
      (whose existence is guaranteed by <xref ref="realEVT"/>).
      Choose <m>\delta > 0</m> such that <m>D[w,\delta] \cap \gg =
      \emptyset</m>; 
      that is, <m>\abs{z-w}\ge \delta</m> for all <m>z</m> on <m>\gamma</m>.
      By the reverse triangle inequality
      (<xref ref="cor_triangleineq"/>(<xref text="local" ref="revtrianineq"/>)),
      for all <m>z \in \gg</m>,
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \left| \frac{ f(z) }{ (z-w-\D w) (z-w)^2 } \right| \ \amp \leq \
          \frac{ \left| f(z) \right| }{ (|z-w|-|\D w|) |z-w|^2 } \
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp \leq
          \ \frac M { (\delta - |\D w|) \delta^2 } \,
        </mrow>
      </md>,
      which certainly stays bounded as <m>\D w \to 0</m>.
      This proves <xref ref="eq_needstostaybounded"/> and thus the
      Cauchy Integral Formula for<nbsp/><m>f'</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof of the formula for <m>f''</m> is very similar and will
      be left to <xref ref="cauchyformula2ex"/>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    <xref ref="cauchyformula2">Theorem</xref>
    suggests that there are similar formulas for the higher
    derivatives of <m>f</m>. 
    This is in fact true,
    and theoretically we could obtain them one by one with the methods
    of the proof of <xref ref="cauchyformula2">Theorem</xref>. 
    However, once we start studying power series for holomorphic functions,
    we will obtain such a result much more easily;
    so we save the derivation of integral formulas for higher
    derivatives of <m>f</m> for later 
    (<xref ref="cauchyformula3">Corollary</xref>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="cauchyformula2"/>
    has several important consequences.
    For starters, it can be used to compute certain integrals.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <me>
        \int_{C[0,1]} \frac{\sin(z)}{z^2} \, \diff{z}
        \ = \ 2 \pi i \left. \frac{d}{\diff{z}} \sin(z) \right|_{z=0}
        \ = \ 2 \pi i \cos(0)
        \ = \ 2 \pi i \,
      </me>.
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example xml:id="ex52">
    <statement>
      <p>
        To compute the integral
        <me>
          \int_{C[0,2]} \frac{\diff{z}}{z^2 (z-1)} \,
        </me>,
        we could employ a partial fractions expansion similar to the
        one in <xref ref="exam_partialfr"/>,
        or moving the integration path similar to the one in <xref
        ref="ex_pathtoinfty"/>.
        To exhibit an alternative,
        we split up the integration path as illustrated in
        <xref ref="ex52fig"/>:
        we introduce an additional path that separates 0 and 1.
        If we integrate on these two new closed paths (<m>\gamma_1</m>
        and <m>\gamma_2</m>) counterclockwise, 
        the two contributions along the new path will cancel each other.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="ex52fig">
        <caption>The integration paths <m>\gamma_1</m> and
        <m>\gamma_2</m>.</caption>
        <image width="55%">
          <prefigure xmlns="https://prefigure.org"
                     label="partial-path">
            <xi:include href="prefigure/partial_path.xml"/>
          </prefigure>
        </image>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The effect is that we transformed an integral for which two
        singularities were inside the integration path into a sum of
        two integrals, 
        each of which has only one singularity inside the integration path;
        these new integrals we know how to deal with,
        using <xref ref="cauchyformulacircle"/>
        and <xref ref="cauchyformula2"/>:
        <md>
          <mrow>\int_{C[0,2]} \frac{\diff{z}}{z^2 (z-1)} \amp \ = \
          \int_{\gamma_1} \frac{\diff{z}}{z^2 (z-1)} + \int_{\gamma_2}
          \frac{\diff{z}}{z^2 (z-1)}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \ = \ \int_{\gamma_1}
          \frac{\frac{1}{z-1}}{z^2} \, \diff{z} + \int_{\gamma_2}
          \frac{\frac{1}{z^2}}{z-1} \, \diff{z}</mrow> 
          <mrow>\amp \ = \ 2 \pi i \left. \frac{ d }{ \diff{z} } \frac{ 1
          }{ z-1 } \right|_{ z=0 } + \ 2 \pi i \, \frac{ 1 }{ 1^2 }
          </mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \ = \
          2 \pi i \left( - \frac{ 1 }{ (-1)^2 }  \right) + 2 \pi
          i</mrow> 
          <mrow>\amp \ = \ 0 \, </mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <me>
        \int_{C[0,1]} \frac{\cos(z)}{z^3} \, \diff{z}
        \ = \ \pi i \left. \frac{d^2}{\diff{z}^2} \cos(z) \right|_{z=0}
        \ = \ \pi i \left( - \cos(0) \right)
        \ = \ - \pi i \,
      </me>.
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    <xref ref="cauchyformula2">Theorem</xref>
    has another powerful consequence:
    just from knowing that <m>f</m> is holomorphic in <m>G</m>,
    we know of the existence of <m>f''</m>, that is,
    <em><m>f'</m> is also holomorphic in <m>G</m></em>.
    Repeating this argument for <m>f'</m>,
    then for <m>f''</m>, <m>f'''</m>,
    etc., shows that all derivatives <m>f^{(n)}</m> exist and are
    holomorphic. 
    We can translate this into the language of partial derivatives,
    since the Cauchy<ndash/>Riemann equations
    (<xref ref="cre"/>)
    show that any sequence of <m>n</m> partial differentiations of
    <m>f</m> results in a constant times <m>f^{(n)}</m>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    So we have the following statement,
    which has no analogue whatsoever in the reals
    (see, e.g., <xref ref="ex_diffbutnottwicediff"/>).
  </p>
  <corollary xml:id="infdiff">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f</m> is differentiable in a region <m>G</m> then
        <m>f</m> is infinitely differentiable in<nbsp/><m>G</m>, 
        and all partials of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m> and
        <m>y</m> exist and are continuous.

    </statement>
