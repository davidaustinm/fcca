  <title>Classification of Singularities</title>
  <p>
    What are the differences among the functions <m>\frac{ \exp(z) - 1
    }{ z }</m>, 
    <m>\frac{ 1 }{ z^4 }</m>, and <m>\exp ( \frac 1 z )</m> at <m>z=0</m>?
    None of them are defined at <m>0</m>,
    but each singularity is of a different nature.
    We will frequently consider functions in this chapter that are
    holomorphic in a disk except at its center 
    (usually because that's where a singularity lies),
    and it will be handy to define the <em>punctured disk</em>
    with center <m>z_0</m> and radius <m>R</m>,
    <me>
      \Dp[z_0, R] \ := \ \left\{ z \in \C : \, 0 \lt  |z-z_0| \lt  R
      \right\} \ = \ D[z_0, R] \setminus \{ z_0 \} \, 
    </me>.

  </p>
  <p>
    We extend this definition naturally with <m>\Dp[z_0, \infty] := \C
    \setminus \{ z_0 \}</m>. 
    For complex functions there are three types of singularities,
    which are classified as follows.

        If <m>f</m> is holomorphic in the punctured disk
        <m>\Dp[z_0, R]</m> for some <m>R>0</m> but not at <m>z=z_0</m>,
        then <m>z_0</m> is an <em>isolated singularity

        (because this power series converges in <m>\C</m>),

    To get a feel for the different types of singularities,

            so <m>g</m> is holomorphic in <m>D[z_0,R]</m>.

            But this power series is holomorphic in <m>D[z_0,R]</m>,

              By <xref ref="classificationzeros"/>,
              there exist a positive integer <m>n</m> and a

              Actually, <m>h(z) \ne 0</m> for all <m>z \in D[z_0,R]</m> since

              Note that <m>\frac1h</m> is holomorphic and non-zero on

              Conversely, suppose <m>z_0</m> is not a removable
              singularity and 
              <m>\lim_{z \to z_0} (z-z_0)^{n+1} f(z) = 0</m> for some
              non-negative integer <m>n</m>.
              We choose the <em>smallest</em> such <m>n</m>.
              By part a),
              <m>h(z) := (z-z_0)^n f(z)</m> has a removable
              singularity at <m>z_0</m>, 
              so there is a holomorphic function <m>g</m> on
              <m>D[z_0,R]</m> that agrees with <m>h</m> on <m>\Dp[z_0,R]</m>.
              Now if <m>n=0</m> this just says that <m>f</m> has a
              removable singularity at <m>z_0</m>, 
              which we have excluded.
              Hence <m>n>0</m>.
              Since <m>n</m> was chosen as small as possible and
              <m>n-1</m> is a non-negative integer less than <m>n</m>, 
              we must have <m>g(z_0) = \lim_{z \to z_0} (z-z_0)^n f(z)
              \ne 0</m>. 
              Summarizing, <m>g</m> is holomorphic on
              <m>D[z_0,R]</m> and non-zero at <m>z_0</m>, <m>n>0</m>, and

    This definition,
    naturally coming out of <xref ref="cor_orderofpole"/>,
    parallels that of the multiplicity of a zero,
    which naturally came out of <xref ref="classificationzeros"/>.
    The two results also show that <m>f</m> has a zero at <m>z_0</m>
    of multiplicity <m>m</m> if and only if 
    <m>\frac 1 f</m> has a pole of order<nbsp/><m>m</m>.
    We will make use of the notions of zeros and poles quite
    extensively in this chapter.

    You might have noticed that the <xref ref="singbasics"/>
    did not include any result on essential singularities.
    Not only does the next theorem make up for this but it also nicely
    illustrates the strangeness of essential singularities. 
    To appreciate the following result,
    we suggest meditating about its statement over a good cup of coffee.

      <p>
        If <m>z_0</m> is an essential singularity of <m>f</m> and
        <m>r</m> is any positive real number, then every <m>w \in
        \C</m> is arbitrarily close to a point in
        <m>f(\Dp[z_0,r])</m>. 
        That is, for any <m>w \in \C</m> and any <m>\epsilon > 0</m>
        there exists

  </theorem>
  <p>
    In the language of topology,
    <xref ref="casoratiweierstrass"/>
    says that the image of any punctured disk centered at an essential
    singularity is <em>dense </em>
    in <m>\C</m>.

  </p>
  <p>
    There is a stronger theorem,
    beyond the scope of this book,
    which implies the Casorati<ndash/>Weierstra&#223;
    <xref ref="casoratiweierstrass"/>
    It is due to Charles Emile Picard (1856<ndash/>1941)
    and says that the image of any punctured disk centered at an
    essential singularity misses at most one point of <m>\C</m>. (It
    is worth coming up with examples of functions that do not miss any
    point in <m>\C</m> and functions that miss exactly one point. 
    <idx><h>Picard's theorem</h></idx>
    Try it!)
  </p>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose (by way of contradiction) that there exist <m>w \in \C</m> and
      <m>\epsilon > 0</m> such that for all <m>z \in \Dp[z_0,r]</m>
      <me>
        |w-f(z)| \ \ge \ \epsilon \,
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the function <m>g(z) := \frac{ 1 }{ f(z) - w }</m> stays
      bounded as <m>z \to z_0</m>, and so 
      <me>
        \lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{ z - z_0}{ f(z) - w } \ = \ \lim_{z \to
        z_0} (z - z_0) \, g(z) \ = \ 0 \, 
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<xref ref="singbasics"/> a) tells us that <m>g</m> has a
      removable singularity at <m>z_0</m>.) Hence 
      <me>
        \lim_{z \to z_0} \left| \frac{ f(z) - w }{ z - z_0} \right| \ = \
        \infty 
      </me>
      and so the function <m>\frac{ f(z) - w }{ z - z_0}</m> has a
      pole at <m>z_0</m>. 
      By <xref ref="singbasics"/> b),
      there is a positive integer <m>n</m> so that
      <me>
        \lim_{ z \to z_0 } (z-z_0)^{ n+1 } \frac{ f(z) - w }{ z - z_0}
        \ = \ \lim_{ z \to z_0 } (z-z_0)^{ n } \left( f(z) - w \right) \ = \
        0 \, 
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Invoking <xref ref="singbasics"/> again,
      we conclude that the function
      <m>f(z) - w</m> has a pole or removable singularity at <m>z_0</m>,
      which implies the same holds for <m>f(z)</m>, a contradiction.

    The following classifies singularities according to their Laurent series,
    and is very often useful in calculations.
