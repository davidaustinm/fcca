      <em>A First Course in Complex Analysis</em> was written for a
      one-semester undergraduate course developed at Binghamton
      University (SUNY) and San Francisco State University, and has been
      adopted at several other institutions. For many of our students,
      Complex Analysis is their first rigorous analysis (if not
      mathematics) class they take, and this book reflects this very
      much. We tried to rely on as few concepts from real analysis as
      possible. In particular, series and sequences are treated from
      scratch, which has the consequence that power series are
      introduced late in the course. The goal our book works toward is
      the Residue Theorem, including some nontraditional applications
      from both continuous and discrete mathematics.

    <p>A printed paperback version of this open textbook is available
    from <url href="http://www.orthogonalpublishing.com">

    <title>About the authors</title>
    
    <p><em>Matthias Beck</em> is a professor in the Mathematics
    Department at San Francisco State University. His research interests
    are in geometric combinatorics and analytic number theory. He is the
    author of three other books,   
    <em>Computing the Continuous Discretely: Integer-point Enumeration
    in Polyhedra</em>  (with Sinai Robins, Springer 2007), 
    <em>The Art of Proof: Basic Training for Deeper Mathematics</em>
    (with Ross Geoghegan, Springer 2010), and 
    <em>Combinatorial Reciprocity Theorems: An Invitation to Enumerative
    Geometric Combinatorics</em> (with Raman Sanyal, AMS 2018).
    </p>
    
    <p> <em>Gerald Marchesi</em> is a lecturer in the Department of
    Mathematical Sciences at Binghamton University (SUNY).
    </p>
    
    <p><em>Dennis Pixton</em> is a professor emeritus in the Department
    of Mathematical Sciences at Binghamton University (SUNY). His
    research interests are in dynamical systems and formal languages.
    </p>
    
    <p><em>Lucas Sabalka</em> is an applied mathematician at a
    technology company in Lincoln, Nebraska.  He works on 3-dimensional
    computer vision applications.  He was formerly a professor of
    mathematics at St. Louis University, after postdoctoral positions
    at UC Davis and Binghamton University (SUNY). His mathematical
    research interests are in geometric group theory, low dimensional
    topology, and computational algebra.
    </p>
    
    <p><em>Robert Chaffer</em> (cover art) is a professor emeritus at
    Central Michigan University. His academic interests are in abstract
    algebra, combinatorics, geometry, and computer applications. Since
    retirement from teaching, he has devoted much of his time to
    applying those interests to creation of art images.

    <title>A Note to Instructors</title>
    
    <p>
      The material in this book should be more than enough for a
      typical semester-long undergraduate course in complex analysis; our
      experience taught us that there is more content in this book than
      fits into one semester. Depending on the nature of your course and
      its place in your department's overall curriculum, some sections can
      be either partially omitted or their definitions and theorems can be
      assumed true without delving into
      proofs. <xref ref="ch_discreteresidues"/> contains optional longer
      homework problems that could also be used as group projects at the
      end of a course. 
    </p>
    
    <p>We would be happy to hear from anyone who has adopted our book
    for their course, as well as suggestions, corrections, or other
    comments.
