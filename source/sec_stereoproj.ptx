  <title>Stereographic Projection</title>
  <p>
    The addition of <m>\infty</m> to the complex plane <m>\C</m> gives
    the plane a useful structure.  This structure is revealed by a
    famous function called <em>stereographic projection</em>, which
    gives us a way of visualizing the extended complex
    plane<mdash/>that is, with the point at infinity<mdash/>in
    <m>\R^3</m>, as the unit sphere.  It also provides a way of seeing
    that a line in the extended complex plane really is a circle, and
    of visualizing M&#xf6;bius functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    To begin, we think of <m>\C</m> as the <m>(x,y)</m>-plane in
    <m>\R^3</m>, that is, <m>\C = \{(x,y,0) \in \R^3\}</m>.  To
    describe stereographic projection, we will be less concerned with
    actual complex numbers <m>x + iy</m> and more concerned with their
    coordinates.  Consider the <em>unit sphere</em>
    <me>
      \mathbb{S}^2 \ := \ \left\{(x,y,z) \in \R^3 : \, x^2+y^2+z^2=1 \right\}
    </me>.
    <idx><h>unit sphere</h></idx>
  </p>
  <p>
    The sphere and the complex plane intersect in the set <m>\{(x,y,0)
    : \, x^2 + y^2 = 1\}</m>, which corresponds to the equator on the
    sphere and the unit circle on the complex plane.  Let
    <m>N:=(0,0,1)</m>, the <em>north pole</em> of <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m>,
    and let <m>S:= (0,0,-1)</m>, the <em>south pole</em>.

        The <em>stereographic projection</em>
        of <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m> to <m>\Chat</m>
        from <m>N</m> is the map <m>\phi \colon \mathbb{S}^2 \to
        \Chat</m> defined as follows.
        <idx><h>stereographic projection</h></idx>
        For any point <m>P \in \mathbb{S}^2 \setminus \{N\}</m>, as
        the <m>z</m>-coordinate 
        of <m>P</m> is strictly less than 1, the line through <m>N</m>
        and <m>P</m> intersects <m>\C</m> in exactly one point, which
        define to be <m>\phi(P)</m>.  We also declare that
        <m>\phi(N) := \infty</m>. <xref ref="fig_sphereandplane"/>
        provides an illustration of this definition.

        The map <m>\phi</m> is given by

        It is bijective, with inverse map

    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Given <m>P = (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{S}^2 \setminus \{N\}</m>,
      the straight line through <m>N</m> and <m>P</m> is parametrized by
      <md>
        <mrow>
          r(t) \amp \ = \ N + t(P-N)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp \ = \ (0,0,1) + t[(x,y,z) - (0,0,1)]
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp \ = \ (tx,\,ty,\, 1+t(z-1))
        </mrow>
      </md>
      where <m>t \in \R</m>.
      When <m>r(t)</m> hits <m>\C</m>,
      the third coordinate is <m>0</m>,
      so it must be that <m>t = \frac{1}{1-z}</m>.
      Plugging this value of <m>t</m> into the formula for <m>r</m>
      yields <m>\phi</m> as stated. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To see the formula for the inverse map <m>\phi^{-1}</m>,
      we begin with a point <m>Q = (p,q,0) \in \C</m> and solve for a point
      <m>P = (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{S}^2</m> so that <m>\phi(P) = Q</m>.
      The point <m>P</m> satisfies the equation <m>x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1</m>.
      The equation <m>\phi(P) = Q</m> tells us that
      <m>\frac{x}{1-z} = p</m> and <m>\frac{y}{1-z} = q</m>.
      Thus, we solve three equations for three unknowns.
      The latter two equations yield
      <me>
        p^2 + q^2 \ = \ \frac{x^2+y^2}{(1-z)^2} \ = \ \frac{1-z^2}{(1-z)^2}
        \ = \ \frac{1+z}{1-z}\, 
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solving <m>p^2 + q^2 = \frac{1+z}{1-z}</m> for <m>z</m> and then
      plugging this into the identities <m>x = p(1-z)</m> and 
      <m>y = q(1-z)</m> proves the desired formula.
      It is easy to check that <m>\phi \circ \phi^{-1}</m> and
      <m>\phi^{-1} \circ \phi</m> are both the identity map;

  <theorem xml:id="StereoCircle">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The stereographic projection <m>\phi</m> takes the set of
        circles in <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m> bijectively to the set of
        circles in <m>\Chat</m>, where for a circle <m>\gamma \subset
        \mathbb{S}^2</m> we have <m>\infty \in \phi(\gamma)</m> (that
        is, <m>\phi(\gamma)</m> is a line in <m>\C</m>) if and only if
        <m>N \in \gamma</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      A circle in <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m> is the intersection of
      <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m> with some plane <m>H</m>.
      If <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> is a normal vector to <m>H</m>,
      then there is a unique real number <m>k</m> so that <m>H</m> is given by
      <md>
        <mrow>
          H \amp \ = \ \left\{(x,y,z) \in \R^3 : \, (x,y,z)\cdot
          (x_0,y_0,z_0) = k \right\}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp \ = \ \left\{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 : \, xx_0 + yy_0 + zz_0
          = k \right\}
        </mrow>
      </md>.
      By possibly changing <m>k</m>,
      we may assume that <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0) \in \mathbb{S}^2</m>.
      We may also assume that <m>0 \leq k \leq 1</m>,
      since if <m>k \lt  0</m> we can replace
      <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> with <m>(-x_0,-y_0,-z_0)</m>,
      and if <m>k > 1</m> then <m>H \cap \mathbb{S}^2 = \emptyset</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the circle of intersection <m>H \cap \mathbb{S}^2</m>.
      A point <m>(p,q,0)</m> in the complex plane lies on the image of
      this circle under <m>\phi</m> if and only if
      <m>\phi^{-1}(p,q,0)</m> satisfies the defining equation for
      <m>H</m>.  Using the equations from <xref
      ref="prop_coordmaps">Proposition</xref> for
      <m>\phi^{-1}(p,q,0)</m>, we see that
      <me>
        (z_0-k)p^2 + (2x_0)p + (z_0-k)q^2 + (2y_0)q \ = \ z_0+k\,
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>z_0-k = 0</m>, this is a straight line in the
      <m>(p,q)</m>-plane.
      Moreover, every line in the <m>(p,q)</m>-plane can be obtained
      in this way.
      Note that <m>z_0 = k</m> if and only if <m>N \in H</m>,
      which is if and only if the image under <m>\phi</m> is a straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>z_0-k \neq 0</m>, then completing the square yields
      <me>
        \left(p+ \frac{x_0}{z_0-k}\right)^2 +
        \left(q+\frac{y_0}{z_0-k} \right)^2 = \
        \frac{1-k^2}{(z_0-k)^2}\, 
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on whether the right hand side of this equation is
      positive, 0, or negative, 
      this is the equation of a circle, point,
      or the empty set in the <m>(p,q)</m>-plane, respectively.
      These three cases happen when <m>k \lt 1</m>, <m>k = 1</m>,
      and <m>k > 1</m>, respectively.
      Only the first case corresponds to a circle in <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m>.
      <xref ref="ex_everycircleins2"/>
      verifies that every circle in the <m>(p,q)</m>-plane arises in this manner.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    We can now think of the extended complex plane as a sphere in <m>\R^3</m>,
    the afore-mentioned <em>Riemann sphere</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is particularly nice to think about the basic M&#xf6;bius
    transformations via their effect on the Riemann sphere.  We will
    describe inversion.  It is worth thinking about, though beyond the
    scope of this book, how other M&#xf6;bius functions behave.  For
    instance, a rotation <m>f(z) = e^{i\theta}z</m>, composed with
    <m>\phi^{-1}</m>, can be seen to be a rotation of
    <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m>.  We encourage you to verify this and consider
    the harder problems of visualizing a real dilation, <m>f(z) =
    rz</m>, or a translation, <m>f(z) = z+b</m>.  We give the hint
    that a real dilation is in some sense dual to a rotation, in that
    each moves points along perpendicular sets of circles.
    Translations can also be visualized via how they move points along
    sets of circles.
  </p>
  <p>
    We now use stereographic projection to take another look at
    <m>f(z)= \frac 1 z</m>.  We want to know what this function does
    to the sphere <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m>.  We will take a point
    <m>(x,y,z)\in \mathbb{S}^2</m>, project it to the plane by the
    stereographic projection <m>\phi</m>, apply <m>f</m> to the point
    that results, and then pull this point back to <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m>
    by<nbsp/><m>\phi^{-1}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We know <m>\phi(x,y,z)=(\frac x {1-z}, \, \frac y {1-z}, \, 0)</m>
    which we now regard as the complex number
    <me>
      p+iq \ = \ \frac{x}{1-z} + i \, \frac{y}{1-z}\,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We know from a previous calculation that <m>p^2+q^2=
    \frac{1+z}{1-z}</m>,
    which gives <m>x^2 + y^2 = (1+z)(1-z)</m>.
    Thus
    <md>
      <mrow>
        f\left( \frac{x}{1-z} + i\frac{y}{1-z}\right) \amp \ = \ \frac{ 1-z }{
        x+iy }
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp \ = \ \frac{ (1-z)(x-iy) }{ x^2 + y^2 }
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp \ = \ \frac{x}{1+z} - i\frac{y}{1+z}\,
      </mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than plug this result into the formulas for
    <m>\phi^{-1}</m>, we can just ask what triple of numbers will be
    mapped to this particular pair using the formulas
    <m>\phi(x,y,z)=(\frac x {1-z}, \, \frac y {1-z}, \, 0)</m>.  The
    answer is <m>(x,-y, -z)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus we have shown that the effect of <m>f(z)= \frac 1 z</m> on
    <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m> is to take <m>(x,y,z)</m> to <m>(x,-y,-z)</m>.
    This is a rotation around the <m>x</m>-axis by 180 degrees.
  </p>
  <p>
    We now have a second argument that <m>f(z)= \frac 1 z</m> takes
    circles and lines to circles and lines.  A circle or line in
    <m>\C</m> is taken to a circle on <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m> by
    <m>\phi^{-1}</m>.  Then <m>f(z)= \frac 1 z</m> rotates the sphere
    which certainly takes circles to circles.  Now <m>\phi</m> takes
    circles back to circles and lines.  We can also say that the
    circles that go to lines under <m>f(z)= \frac 1 z</m> are the
    circles through 0, because 0 is mapped to <m>(0,0,-1)</m> under
    <m>\phi^{-1}</m>, and so a circle through 0 in <m>\C</m> goes to a
    circle through the south pole in <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m>.  Now
    180-degree rotation about the <m>x</m>-axis takes the south pole
    to the north pole, and our circle is now passing through <m>N</m>.
    But we know that <m>\phi</m> will take this circle to a line in
    <m>\C</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We end by mentioning that there is, in fact, a way of putting the
    complex metric on <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m>.  It is certainly not the
    (finite) distance function induced by <m>\R^3</m>.  Indeed, the
    origin in the complex plane corresponds to the south pole of
    <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m>.  We have to be able to get arbitrarily far
    away from the origin in <m>\C</m>, so the complex distance
    function has to increase greatly with the <m>z</m> coordinate.
    The closer points are to the north pole <m>N</m> (corresponding to
    <m>\infty</m> in <m>\Chat</m>), the <em>larger</em> their distance
    to the origin, and to each other!  In this light, a <q>line</q>
    in the Riemann sphere <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m> corresponds to a circle
    in <m>\mathbb{S}^2</m> through <m>N</m>.  In the regular sphere,
    the circle has finite length, but as a line on the Riemann sphere
    with the complex metric, it has infinite length.
