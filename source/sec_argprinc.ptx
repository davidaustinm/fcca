  <title>Argument Principle and Rouch&#xe9;'s Theorem</title>
  <p>
    In the previous section we saw how to compute integrals via residues,
    but in many applications we actually do not have an explicit
    expression for a function that we need to integrate 
    (or this expression is very complicated).
    However, it may still be possible to compute the value of a
    function at any given point. 
    In this situation we cannot immediately apply the Residue Theorem
    because we don't know where the singularities are. 
    Of course, we could use numerical integration to compute integrals
    over any path, 
    but computationally this task could be very resource intensive.
    But if we do know the singularities,
    we can compute the residues numerically by computing a finite
    number of the integrals over small circles around these
    singularities. 
    And after that we can apply the residue theorem to compute the
    integral over any closed path very effectively: 
    we just sum up the residues inside this path.
    The argument principle that we study below,
    in particular, addresses this question.
    We start by introducing the logarithmic derivative.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose we have a differentiable function <m>f</m>.
    Differentiating <m>\fLog f</m>
    (where <m>\fLog</m> is some branch of the logarithm)
    gives <m>\frac{f'}{f}</m>,
    which is one good reason to call this quotient the
    <em>logarithmic derivative</em>
    of <m>f</m>.
    <idx><h>logarithmic derivative</h></idx>
    It has some remarkable properties,
    one of which we would like to discuss here.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now let's say we have two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
    holomorphic in some region. 
    Then the logarithmic derivative of their product behaves very nicely:
    <me>
      \frac{ (fg)' }{ fg } \ = \ \frac{ f' g + f g' }{ fg } \ = \ \frac{ f'
      }{ f } + \frac{ g' }{ g } \, 
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can apply this fact to the following situation: Suppose that
    <m>f</m> is holomorphic in a region <m>G</m> and <m>f</m> has 
    (finitely many)
    zeros <m>z_1, \dots,
    z_j</m> of multiplicities <m>n_1, \dots, n_j</m>, respectively.
    By <xref ref="classificationzeros"/>,
    we can express <m>f</m> as
    <me>
      f(z) \ = \ ( z - z_1 )^{n_1} \cdots ( z - z_j )^{n_j} g(z) \,
    </me>,
    where <m>g</m> is also holomorphic in <m>G</m> and never zero.
    Let's compute the logarithmic derivative of <m>f</m> and play the same remarkable cancellation game as above:
    <md>
      <mrow>\frac{ f'(z) }{ f(z) } \amp \ = \ \frac{n_1 (z - z_1)^{n_1-1}
      (z - z_2)^{n_2} \cdots (z - z_j)^{n_j} g(z) + \dots + ( z - z_1
      )^{n_1} \cdots ( z - z_j )^{n_j} g'(z) }{ ( z - z_1 )^{n_1}
      \cdots ( z - z_j )^{n_j} g(z) } \nonumber</mrow> 
      <mrow xml:id="logderzeros" number="yes">\amp \ = \ \frac{ n_1 }{ z
      - z_1 } + \frac{ n_2 }{ z - z_2 } + \cdots + \frac{ n_j }{ z -
      z_j } + \frac{ g'(z) }{ g(z) } \, </mrow> 
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Something similar happens if <m>f</m> has finitely many poles in <m>G</m>.
    In <xref ref="ex_logderpoles">Exercise</xref>,
    we invite you to prove that, if
    <m>p_1, \dots, p_k</m> are all the poles of <m>f</m> in <m>G</m>
    with order <m>m_1, \dots, m_k</m>, 
    respectively,
    then the logarithmic derivative of <m>f</m> can be expressed as
    <men xml:id="logderpoles">
      \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} \ = \ - \frac{ m_1 }{ z - p_1 } -
      \frac{m_2}{z - p_2} - \dots - \frac{ m_k }{ z - p_k } + \frac{
      g'(z) }{ g(z) } \, 
    </men>,
    where <m>g</m> is a function without poles in <m>G</m>.
    Naturally, we can combine the expressions for zeros and poles,
    as we will do in a moment.

        (You may meditate about the fact why there can be only

        Thanks to Cauchy's <xref ref="cauchythm"/>
        and <xref ref="ex_circleint">Exercise</xref>, the integral is easy:

        Finally, <m>\frac{g'}{g}</m> is holomorphic in <m>G</m>
        (because <m>g</m> is never zero in <m>G</m>),

      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    As mentioned above,
    this beautiful theorem helps to locate poles and zeroes of a
    function <m>f</m>. 
    The idea is simple: we can first numerically integrate
    <m>\frac{f'}{f}</m> over a big circle <m>\gamma</m> that includes
    all possible paths over which we potentially will be integrating
    <m>f</m>. 
    Then the numerical value of
    <m>\frac{ 1 }{ 2 \pi i } \int_{\gamma} \frac{ f' }{ f }</m> will
    be close to an integer that, 
    according to the Argument Principle,
    equals <m>Z(f,\gamma)-P(f,\gamma)</m>.
    Then we can integrate <m>\frac{f'}{f}</m> over a smaller closed path
    <m>\gamma_1</m> that encompasses half of the interior of
    <m>\gamma</m> and find <m>Z(f,\gamma_1)-P(f,\gamma_1)</m>. 
    Continuing this process for smaller and smaller regions will
    (after certain verification)
    produce small regions where <m>f</m> has exactly one zero or
    exactly one pole. 
    Integrating <m>f</m> over the boundaries of those small regions
    that contain poles and dividing by <m>2\pi i</m> gives all
    residues of<nbsp/><m>f</m>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Another nice related application of the Argument Principle is a
    famous theorem due to Eugene Rouch&#xe9; (1832<ndash/>1910).

  <p>
    This theorem is of surprising practicality.
    It allows us to locate the zeros of a function fairly precisely.
    Here is an illustration.

        All the roots of the polynomial

        <idx><h>fundamental theorem</h><h>of algebra</h></idx>
        What's special about the statement of

        is that they all have modulus <m>\lt 2</m>.
        Note also that there is no general formula for computing roots
        of a polynomial of degree 5. (Although for this <m>p</m> it's
        not hard to find one root<mdash/>and therefore all of them.) 
        </fn> To see this,
        let <m>f(z) = z^5</m> and <m>g(z) = z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1</m>.
