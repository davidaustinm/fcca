It is amusing that such an important algebraic result can be proved purely analytically.  There are proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that do not use complex analysis.  On the other hand, all proofs use some analysis (such as the Intermediate Value Theorem).  The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra refers to algebra in the sense that it existed in 1799, not to modern algebra. Thus one might say that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is neither fundamental to algebra nor even a theorem of algebra. The proof we give here is due to Anton R. Schep and appeared in the American Mathematical Monthly (January 2009).">Theorem 5.3.2</a>) is to say that <span class="process-math">\(\C\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">algebraically closed </em>. In contrast, <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> is not algebraically closed.</div>
